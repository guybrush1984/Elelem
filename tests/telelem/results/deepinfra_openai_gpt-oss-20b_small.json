      "step1": "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment or grease with butter and dust with flour. In a large bowl whisk together 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup and ¼ for cocoa, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp baking soda, and pinch of salt. Combine well and set aside.",
      "step2": "In another bowl, whisk 3 eggs, 1 cup buttermilk, ½ cup melted unsalted butter, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and ½ tsp almond extract. Pour wet ingredients over dry mixture, stirring until just combined. Avoid overmixing to keep cake light and airy.",
      "step3": "Add 1 cup hot coffee to batter, whisking until smooth and glossy. Then fold in ½ cup melted dark chocolate, whisking until fully incorporated. The coffee deepens flavor while the chocolate adds richness; ensure batter remains smooth for even rise.",
      "step4": "Divide batter evenly into the prepared pan. Tap once to release air bubbles and smooth surface. Place pan in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes. Check doneness by inserting a toothpick in center; it should come out with few moist crumbs.",
      "step5": "Remove cake from oven, let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn onto a wire rack. While still warm, drizzle a thin glaze of ¼ cup melted dark chocolate and ¼ cup heavy cream over the top, letting it set before frosting.",
      "step6": "After icing has set, frosted cake with smooth swirl of chocolate ganache: whisk ⅔ cup melted chocolate with ¼ cup heavy cream, 1 tsp vanilla, drizzle over cake, and refrigerate briefly. Slice and serve with fresh berries or whipped cream if desired. Enjoy!"
