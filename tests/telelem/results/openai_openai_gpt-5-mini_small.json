      "step1": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round pans. Gather ingredients for eight servings: 1¾ cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1½ teaspoons baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt plus 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, ½ cup oil, 2 teaspoons vanilla.",
      "step2": "Whisk the dry ingredients: sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. In a separate bowl beat two room-temperature eggs with milk, oil, and vanilla until combined. Gradually stir wet mixture into dry until batter appears smooth and evenly moistened. Do not overmix please",
      "step3": "Stir in one cup boiling water slowly; batter will thin and glossy. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans, tapping to remove air bubbles. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out with moist crumbs but no wet batter please",
      "step4": "Cool cakes in pans on a wire rack for ten minutes. Run a knife around edges and invert onto rack. Cool completely until room temperature, about one hour. Meanwhile make frosting by creaming ½ cup softened butter with 1½ cups powdered sugar, ½ cup cocoa, 2 tablespoons milk, and vanilla",
      "step5": "Beat frosting until light and spreadable. If too stiff add a teaspoon of milk at a time. Place first cake layer on serving plate, spread a third of frosting evenly, top with second layer, press. Frost top and sides with remaining frosting, smoothing with an offset spatula for clean edges",
      "step6": "Let frosted cake rest on rack for at least 30 minutes to set frosting. Slice into twelve generous pieces or eight large slices for eight servings. Serve with fresh berries or a dusting of cocoa. Store leftovers covered at room temperature up to two days, refrigerate for longer freshness Enjoy"
