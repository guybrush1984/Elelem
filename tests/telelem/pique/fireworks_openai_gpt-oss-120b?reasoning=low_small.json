In a large bowl whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and 1\u202f\u00bd teaspoons salt to ensure even rising and balanced flavor throughout the batter overall.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Combine wet ingredients in a separate bowl: melt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, then stir in 2 cups granulated sugar until smooth. Beat in 4 large eggs one at a time, followed by 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, creating a glossy mixture that will help bind the dry components.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the wet batter, folding gently with a rubber spatula. Pour in \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 cup buttermilk, and \u00bd cup hot water, stirring just until the batter is smooth and glossy, avoiding over\u2011mixing to keep it tender and light in texture.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with an offset spatula. Tap each pan lightly on the counter to release air bubbles. Place pans on the middle rack of the preheated oven, and bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean perfectly.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for ten minutes. Then run a knife around the edges, invert onto racks, and allow to cool completely. While cooling, prepare the frosting by whisking together 1 cup cream, 8 ounces melted chocolate, and a pinch salt.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Spread a generous layer of chocolate frosting on the first cake layer, then place the second layer atop. Frost the top and sides smoothly, using an offset spatula for even coverage. Garnish with shaved chocolate, fresh berries, or a dusting of cocoa powder, then slice and serve immediately with joy.\"\n}",
