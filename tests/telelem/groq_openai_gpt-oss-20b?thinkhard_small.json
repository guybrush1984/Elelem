Gather ingredients: 1\u00be cups all-purpose flour, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa, 2 cups sugar, 1\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, \u00bd teaspoon salt. Set aside. All ingredients should be at room temperature for best results today.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until evenly mixed. Use a fine sieve to ensure no lumps. Gradually add powdered sugar, stirring continuously. This dry mix will form the cake's tender crumb and rich flavor foundation today.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Beat 3 eggs at room temperature in a separate bowl. Add 1 cup whole milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Whisk until frothy. Slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry batter, folding gently to combine. Avoid overmixing; the batter should be smooth and slightly glossy.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Tap pans lightly to release air bubbles. Bake for 30\u201335 minutes, checking doneness with a toothpick inserted in the center. It should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Remove and cool on wire racks.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Whisk 1 cup butter until creamy. Gradually sift 3 cups powdered sugar, \u00bd cup cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt into the butter. Add \u00bc cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and \u00bc cup milk. Beat until light and fluffy, adjusting consistency with additional cream or sugar as needed.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Let cooled cakes rest for 10 minutes before removing pans. Place one layer on a plate, spread frosting evenly, then top with second layer. Decorate with chocolate shavings or berries. Slice with a clean knife, serve immediately, and enjoy a moist, velvety chocolate cake perfect for eight guests and smiles.\"\n}",
