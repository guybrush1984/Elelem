In a large bowl combine 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd cups granulated sugar, 1\u202fcup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking soda, 1\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, and 1\u202f teaspoon salt. Mix thoroughly until smooth.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate medium bowl whisk together 1 cup buttermilk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract until blended. Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring gently with a spatula. Add 1 cup hot water, mixing until batter is thin and glossy.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Tap the pans lightly on the counter to release any air bubbles. Place them in the preheated oven and bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean and golden brown.\",\n  \"step4\": \"While the cakes cool, prepare the frosting. In a saucepan melt \u00bd cup unsalted butter over medium heat, then stir in 2\u202f\u00be cups powdered sugar, \u00be cup cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt. Slowly whisk in \u00bc cup heavy cream and 1 teaspoon vanilla until smooth and glossy perfectly.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Allow the frosting to cool slightly, then beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2\u20113 minutes until light and airy. If the consistency is too thick, add a tablespoon of milk; if too thin, incorporate additional powdered sugar until spreadable but firm enough to hold layers for stability.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Place one cake layer on a serving plate, spread a generous amount of chocolate frosting over the top, then carefully position the second layer. Frost the top and sides evenly, smoothing with an offset spatula. Garnish with chocolate shavings or fresh berries, then refrigerate 20 minutes before slicing and serving.\"\n}",
