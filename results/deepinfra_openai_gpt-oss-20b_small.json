      "step1": "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9‑inch round cake pans. In a medium bowl whisk 1 cup all‑purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1/2 tsp salt. Set aside.",
      "step2": "In a tall glass measuring cup, combine 1 cup mug‑warm milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 tbsp white wine vinegar. Stir until vinegar neutralizes and batter feels slightly thick. Pour this liquid mixture over the dry ingredients, whisking until smooth, no lumps.",
      "step3": "Sift an additional 1 cup flour over the batter to maintain structure. Fold gently with a rubber spatula, avoiding overmixing. If the mixture appears too thin, add 1–2 tbsp extra flour for density; if too thick, add 1 tbsp milk to loosen. Portion into the prepared pans evenly.",
      "step4": "Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean. Remove from oven, let cool in pans 5 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. Thinly slice the cake later for layering.",
      "step5": "For the frosting, whisk 1/4 cup softened butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 cup powdered sugar until creamy. Add 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa, 2 tsp milk, and a pinch of salt; mix until glossy. Sweep frosting between cake layers, then cover sides and top of cake.",
      "step6": "Decore as desired: dust with powdered sugar, scatter chocolate shavings, or add a drizzle of ganache. Chill cake 30 minutes before serving to set frosting. Slice with a hot knife for clean borders. Enjoy a moist chocolate pull‑apart cake for eight guests."
