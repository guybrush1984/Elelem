In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 cups of sugar, \u00be cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and salt.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate medium bowl, combine your wet ingredients. Lightly beat 2 large eggs, then stir in 1 cup of buttermilk, \u00bd cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Mix until everything is well combined before moving on to the next step of combining.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Slowly pour in 1 cup of boiling water or hot coffee, mixing until the batter is smooth. The batter will be very thin and liquid-like, which is perfectly normal for this type of cake.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. To check for doneness, insert a wooden skewer into the center of each cake; it should come out clean when the cakes are ready to be removed.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans on a wire rack for about 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, carefully run a knife around the edges and invert the cakes onto the wire rack to cool completely before you begin the frosting process.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once the layers are completely cool, assemble your cake. Place one layer on a serving platter and spread it with your favorite chocolate frosting. Place the second layer on top, then frost the top and sides of the entire cake. Slice into 8 pieces and enjoy your creation!\"\n}\n```",
