      "introduction": "Before the transformer era, language modeling progressed through statistical and early neural approaches that reflected the computational limits of their time. IBM's 1990s word‑alignment models laid the groundwork for corpus‑based translation, while smoothed n‑gram models in the early 2000s achieved state‑of‑the‑art perplexities on large web‑derived corpora. The 2000s also saw the first neural language models, which later benefited from deep learning breakthroughs in vision, leading to word embeddings and LSTM‑based sequence‑to‑sequence systems. This historical trajectory sets the stage for the transformative impact of the transformer architecture introduced in 2017.",
      "development": "The pivotal 2017 NeurIPS paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" replaced recurrent components with multi‑head self‑attention, enabling parallel processing and stronger context modeling. Its encoder‑decoder design spawned encoder‑only models like BERT (2018) and decoder‑only models such as GPT‑1 (2018) and GPT‑2 (2019), the latter attracting attention for its scale and potential misuse. GPT‑3 (2020) expanded capabilities further, though access remained API‑only, and ChatGPT (2022) popularized conversational AI. GPT‑4 (2023) added multimodal reasoning, while OpenAI's o1 (2024) introduced explicit chain‑of‑thought prompting. Parallel to proprietary advances, open‑source initiatives emerged: BLOOM and LLaMA (2022) provided large publicly‑available weights, albeit with usage restrictions; Mistral AI released permissively‑licensed 7B and 8x7B models; DeepSeek R1 (2025) offered a 671‑billion‑parameter open‑weight model rivaling closed‑source counterparts. Since 2023, many LLMs have incorporated multimodal inputs and outputs, earning the label large multimodal models (LMMs). While transformers dominate the largest systems as of 2024, alternative architectures like recurrent variants and the state‑space Mamba model have also been explored, highlighting ongoing research diversity beyond the transformer paradigm.",
      "conclusion": "From statistical n‑grams to transformer‑based LLMs, the field has evolved dramatically, with open‑source models and multimodal capabilities now shaping the future of AI language technology."
