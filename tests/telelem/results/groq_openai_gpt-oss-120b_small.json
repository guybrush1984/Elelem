      "step1": "Gather ingredients for an eight‑serving chocolate cake: 2 ½ cups all‑purpose flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2  teaspoons baking soda, 1  teaspoon baking powder, 1  teaspoon salt, 1  cup buttermilk, ½ cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 2  teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1  cup hot water. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9‑inch round cake pans, lining them with parchment for easy release.",
      "step2": "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together dry ingredients: flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until uniformly combined. In a separate bowl, blend wet components: buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla, mixing until smooth. Gradually pour wet mixture into dry, stirring gently to form a thick batter, careful not to over‑mix.",
      "step3": "Slowly incorporate the hot water into the batter, stirring continuously; the batter will become thin and glossy, which is normal for chocolate cake. Ensure the mixture is smooth with no lumps. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula for even baking.",
      "step4": "Place the pans in the preheated oven on the middle rack. Bake for 30‑35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean or with a few moist crumbs. Rotate the pans halfway through baking for uniform rise, then remove from oven and cool in pans for 10 minutes.",
      "step5": "After the initial cooling, run a thin knife around the edges to loosen the cakes, then invert them onto a wire rack. Peel off parchment paper and let the layers cool completely, about 20‑30 minutes, before frosting. This prevents frosting from melting and ensures clean layers.",
      "step6": "Prepare a chocolate buttercream: beat 1  cup softened butter, add 3  cups powdered sugar, ¾  cup cocoa powder, 2  teaspoons vanilla, and 2‑3  tablespoons milk, whipping until light and fluffy. Spread a generous layer of frosting between the two cooled cake layers, then cover the top and sides, decorating as desired."
