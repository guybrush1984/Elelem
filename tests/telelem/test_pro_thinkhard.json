In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 cups of sugar, \u00be cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt until well combined.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate medium bowl, combine 2 large eggs, 1 cup of buttermilk (or milk), \u00bd cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Whisk these wet ingredients together until they are smooth and fully incorporated, ensuring the eggs are well beaten into the mixture.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients. Mix on a low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Slowly and carefully pour in 1 cup of boiling water (or hot coffee) and continue to mix until smooth. The batter will be very thin.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the batter evenly between your two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack.\",\n  \"step5\": \"To make the frosting, beat 1 cup of softened butter until creamy. Gradually add 3 cups of powdered sugar and \u00bd cup of cocoa powder, alternating with \u00bd cup of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Beat on high speed until the frosting is light and fluffy.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving platter and spread a generous amount of frosting over it. Place the second layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the entire cake. Garnish with chocolate shavings if desired before slicing and serving your delicious cake.\"\n}\n```",
