Preheat oven to 180\u00b0C, grease a 20\u202fcm round tin, line with parchment, and set aside.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Melt chocolate and butter together over low heat, stirring until smooth. Let the mixture cool slightly. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs and sugar until pale and fluffy, then fold in vanilla. Gradually pour the chocolate blend into the egg mixture, mixing gently.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Add this dry mix to the wet mixture in three portions, folding each time until just incorporated. Add milk gradually to reach a thick, smooth batter that coats the back of a spoon.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the batter into the prepared tin, smoothing the surface. Tap gently on the counter to release air bubbles. Bake for 25\u201130 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center emerges clean, indicating a moist crumb and firm top.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Remove the cake from the oven and cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool fully. For extra flavor, sprinkle a dusting of cocoa powder or drizzle simple chocolate glaze over the top once cooled.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Slice the cake into eight equal portions, serve plain or with whipped cream and berries for a celebratory touch. Store leftover slices wrapped tightly in foil at room temperature or refrigerate for up to three days, refreshing with a splash of milk before serving.\"\n}\n```",
