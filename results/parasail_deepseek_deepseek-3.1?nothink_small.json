      "step1": "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups flour, 1¾ cups sugar, ¾ cup cocoa, 2 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp baking powder until well combined.",
      "step2": "Add 1 cup buttermilk, 1 cup strong coffee (cooled), ½ cup vegetable oil, and 2 eggs to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed for 2 minutes until smooth and well blended, scraping bowl sides as needed.",
      "step3": "Pour batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool cakes in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.",
      "step4": "For frosting, beat 1 cup softened butter until creamy. Gradually add 3½ cups powdered sugar and 1 cup cocoa, mixing on low. Add ½ cup milk and 2 tsp vanilla; beat on high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.",
      "step5": "Place one cake layer on a plate. Spread a generous layer of frosting over top. Place second layer on top. Frost top and sides of cake with remaining frosting, smoothing with a spatula for even coverage.",
      "step6": "Optionally garnish with chocolate shavings or sprinkles. Allow cake to set for 30 minutes before slicing. Serve at room temperature. Store any leftovers covered at room temperature for up to 3 days for best freshness and flavor."
