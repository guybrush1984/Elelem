In a large mixing bowl, whisk together all your dry ingredients: flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Sifting them first helps prevent lumps and creates a finer crumb.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate medium bowl, lightly beat two large eggs. Then, whisk in the milk, vegetable oil, and pure vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Preparing the wet ingredients separately helps to avoid over-mixing the final batter, which ensures a soft, tender cake.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients, mixing on a low speed until everything is just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then carefully stir in one cup of boiling water or hot coffee. The batter will be thin; this is key to a moist cake.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the thin batter evenly between your two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely.\",\n  \"step5\": \"To make the frosting, beat softened butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until it is light and creamy. Gradually add sifted cocoa powder and powdered sugar, alternating with milk and a splash of vanilla. Beat on high speed until the frosting is fluffy and perfectly spreadable.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on your serving platter. Spread a generous amount of frosting over the top. Carefully place the second layer on top, then frost the top and sides of the entire cake. Decorate with chocolate shavings for a simple, elegant finish.\"\n}\n```",
