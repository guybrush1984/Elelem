Measure ingredients for eight servings: 2\u00bd cups flour, 2\u00bd cups sugar, \u00be cup cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 1 cup buttermilk, \u00bd cup oil, 2 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1 cup hot water.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl to ensure even distribution and remove lumps. Whisk the dry mixture gently for about 30 seconds, creating a light, airy texture. Set the bowl aside while you prepare the wet ingredients, keeping the dry side ready for quick incorporation.\",\n  \"step3\": \"In a separate bowl, beat softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3\u20114 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, incorporating each fully before the next, then stir in vanilla extract. Finally, blend in buttermilk and oil, mixing just until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Gradually pour the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, folding gently with a rubber spatula to avoid over\u2011mixing. Once mostly combined, then slowly stir in the hot water, which will thin the batter and intensify chocolate flavor. The batter will appear thin but glossy and smooth, perfect for baking.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean. Rotate pans halfway for even browning, then remove cakes and let cool in pans for 10 minutes.\",\n  \"step6\": \"After cooling, run a thin knife around each cake\u2019s edges to release from the pans, then invert onto a wire rack. Prepare a chocolate ganache by heating cream and pouring over chopped dark chocolate, stirring until glossy. Frost the layers, drizzle extra ganache, and serve slices to eight guests.\"\n}",
