In a large bowl, whisk together 1 \u00be cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking soda, and 1 teaspoon baking powder.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In another bowl, combine 1 cup buttermilk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 cup strong hot coffee. The coffee enhances the chocolate flavor without making the cake taste like coffee.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing on medium speed with an electric mixer until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter; overmixing can lead to a dry cake.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Baking times may vary.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely. Ensure cakes are fully cool before frosting to prevent the frosting from melting.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Prepare your favorite chocolate frosting. Once cakes are cool, spread a generous layer of frosting between the two layers and then cover the top and sides of the cake. Garnish with chocolate shavings if desired.\"\n}\n```",
