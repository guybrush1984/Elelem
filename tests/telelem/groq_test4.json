Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease a 9\u2011inch round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, cocoa, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until well blended. Set aside. This dry mixture will form the cake\u2019s structure and chocolate flavor, ensuring even crumb distribution and a tender finish.\",\n  \"step3\": \"In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, buttermilk, oil, vanilla, and hot coffee until smooth. The coffee intensifies chocolate without adding bitterness, while buttermilk contributes acidity for a moist crumb. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir with a spatula just until combined; overmixing can toughen the cake.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Tap the pan lightly on the counter to remove air bubbles. Bake in the preheated oven for 30\u201335 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean with a few crumbs. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Transfer the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 25 minutes. While cooling, prepare a simple ganache: heat \u00bd cup heavy cream until steaming, pour over 8 ounces chopped dark chocolate, stir until silky smooth. Drizzle ganache over the cooled cake, allowing it to set for 10 minutes before slicing.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Serve the chocolate cake in eight portions, optionally garnishing each slice with a dusting of powdered sugar or a few fresh berries for contrast. Store leftover slices in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or refrigerate for longer freshness.\"\n}\n```",
