In a large bowl whisk together 1\u00bd cups flour, \u00be cup cocoa powder, 2 cups sugar, 1\u00bd tsp baking powder, 1\u00bd tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp salt. Set aside.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl whisk 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 tsp vanilla until smooth. Add 1 cup boiling water, stirring until combined. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, beating on medium speed for 2 minutes until batter is silky.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans. Tap pans gently on the counter to release air bubbles. Bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes.\",\n  \"step4\": \"While cakes cool, prepare frosting: beat \u00bd cup softened butter until fluffy. Gradually add 3 cups powdered sugar, \u00bc cup cocoa powder, 2 tbsp milk, and 1 tsp vanilla. Beat until light and spreadable, adding more milk if needed for desired consistency.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous layer of frosting over the top. Place the second layer on top, then apply a thin crumb coat all around the cake. Chill for 15 minutes to set the crumb coat before the final frosting layer.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Finish by frosting the sides and top of the cake with the remaining frosting. Decorate with chocolate shavings or sprinkles if desired. Slice, serve, and enjoy a moist, rich chocolate cake perfect for 8 guests.\"\n}",
