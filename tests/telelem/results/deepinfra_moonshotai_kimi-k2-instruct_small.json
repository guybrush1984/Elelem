      "step1": "Heat oven to 180°C/350°F. Grease two 20-cm tins, line bases with parchment. Whisk 250g soft butter, 250g light brown sugar until fluffy. Add 4 eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition to build airy structure.",
      "step2": "Sift 200g plain flour, 75g cocoa, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate, pinch salt. Fold dry mix into butter mixture in three additions, alternating with 150ml buttermilk to keep batter smooth and silky.",
      "step3": "Dissolve 2 tsp instant coffee in 100ml boiling water, stir in 1 tsp vanilla. Pour hot coffee into batter and fold quickly; it will loosen and deepen chocolate flavor, creating glossy, pourable mixture ready for pans.",
      "step4": "Divide batter evenly between tins, level tops with spatula. Bake 25–28 mins until skewer from centre comes out with moist crumb. Let cakes rest 10 mins, then turn onto rack to cool completely before filling.",
      "step5": "For ganache, heat 200ml double cream until just steaming, pour over 200g chopped dark chocolate. Sit 2 mins, then stir until satin smooth. Chill 15 mins until spreadable. Beat briefly for fluffy frosting ready to coat cake.",
      "step6": "Stack layers with thin ganache coat, then cover entire cake. Swirl top with palette knife, dust with cocoa. Chill 30 mins to set, serve at room temp creating 8 moist, rich slices. Keep leftovers airtight 3 days."
