In a large mixing bowl, sift together 1 \u00be cups all\u2011purpose flour, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 cups granulated sugar, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Whisk until evenly combined.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup buttermilk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1 cup boiling water. Pour the wet mixture slowly into the dry ingredients, stirring gently with a spatula until a smooth batter forms. The batter should be pourable but not overly thin.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Tap the pans gently on the counter to release any large air pockets. Place the pans on the middle rack of the preheated oven and bake for 25\u201330 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then transfer the layers onto a wire rack to cool completely\u2014about 20\u201325 minutes. While cooling, whisk together \u00be cup unsalted butter, 3 cups powdered sugar, \u00bc cup cocoa powder, and \u00bd cup milk until smooth for the ganache.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Once the cakes are fully cooled, place one layer on a serving plate and spread a generous layer of ganache across the top. Carefully set the second layer on top of the ganache, press lightly, and then spread ganache over the entire cake, smoothing with a spatula. Chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to set.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Before serving, garnish with chocolate shavings, cocoa nibs, or fresh berries if desired. Slice with a clean, sharp knife, serve individual portions, and enjoy the moist, rich chocolate cake that feeds eight people.\"\n}\n```",
