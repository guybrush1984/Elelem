Gather all ingredients: 1 and 3/4 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, 1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 and 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 2 tsp vanilla extract, and 1 cup boiling water.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This ensures even distribution of the dry ingredients and a smooth batter. Mix well with a whisk to combine all the dry ingredients thoroughly before adding the wet ingredients.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat the mixture on medium speed using an electric mixer or whisk until smooth and well combined. The batter should be thick but pourable, with no lumps remaining for a perfect cake texture.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Carefully stir in the boiling water into the batter. The batter will be thin, but this is normal and helps create a moist cake. Mix gently until the water is fully incorporated, ensuring the batter is smooth and evenly mixed without overbeating.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Tap the pan gently on the counter to release any air bubbles. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Check doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting or enjoy as is. Slice and serve your delicious chocolate cake for 8!\"\n}",
