In a large bowl, whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and 1\u202f\u00bd teaspoons salt to ensure even distribution through the mixing process before adding wet.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Combine wet ingredients in a separate bowl: beat 1 cup (240\u202fml) melted butter with 2\u202fcups granulated sugar until light and fluffy, then add 4 large eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla extract for flavor depth and rich aroma to the batter overall.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the wet butter\u2011sugar blend, stirring gently with a spatula until just combined. Fold in \u00be cup (180\u202fml) sour cream for moisture, then incorporate \u00bd cup (120\u202fml) whole milk, ensuring a smooth, glossy batter without overmixing or air bubbles that could spoil texture later.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Prepare the chocolate ganache: melt 8 ounces (225\u202fg) dark chocolate with \u00bd cup (120\u202fml) heavy cream over a double boiler, stirring constantly until silky. Add 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, a pinch of sea salt, and whisk until glossy, then set aside to cool slightly before folding into the cake batter.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean with a few moist crumbs. Remove cakes from oven, let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack carefully.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once completely cooled, place one layer on a serving plate, spread half of the ganache evenly, then top with the second cake layer. Frost the top and sides with remaining ganache, smoothing with an offset spatula. Garnish with chocolate shavings or fresh berries, slice, and serve to eight delighted guests.\"\n}",
