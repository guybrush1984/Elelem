      "introduction": "Language models have significantly evolved over the past few decades, transitioning from early statistical methods to advanced neural network architectures. Initial innovations in the 1990s, such as IBM's statistical models, laid the foundation for corpus-based language modeling. The 2000s saw the rise of neural networks for language tasks, culminating in the groundbreaking introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017. This architecture revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), enabling the development of powerful models like BERT and GPT, which have reshaped research, industry applications, and user interactions with AI-driven language technologies.",
      "development": "Before transformers, language models primarily relied on statistical techniques and n-gram models, with significant progress marked by IBM's word alignment methods and smoothed n-gram models like those employing Kneser–Ney smoothing. With the growth of internet data, researchers compiled massive corpora, advancing statistical modeling further. Starting around 2000, neural networks began to replace earlier methods, with the introduction of word embeddings like Word2Vec and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models using LSTM architectures. These models powered early neural machine translation systems, including Google’s 2016 switch to NMT. The 2017 introduction of the transformer model at NeurIPS, based on the attention mechanism, marked a pivotal shift. Transformers eliminated recurrent structures, improving efficiency and performance. The ensuing years saw the emergence of models such as BERT (encoder-only) in 2018, which became widely used in academia and industry until declination in 2023 as decoder-only models advanced. OpenAI's GPT series, starting with GPT-1 in 2018, gained widespread attention particularly with GPT-2 in 2019 and GPT-3 in 2020. GPT-3, accessible only via API, demonstrated impressive capabilities, while the 2022 launch of ChatGPT brought extensive public engagement. The 2023 GPT-4 further enhanced accuracy and introduced multimodal functionalities, though detailed architecture remained undisclosed. These advancements fueled a surge in LLM applications across disciplines such as robotics and software engineering. Concurrently, the growth of source-available models like BLOOM, LLaMA, and Mistral AI's offerings addressed licensing and accessibility concerns. In 2025, DeepSeek R1 emerged as a highly capable open-weight model at lower cost. Recent trends focus on building large multimodal models (LMMs) that integrate vision and audio processing alongside text. Despite attempts with alternative architectures, transformer-based models dominate the field by 2024, reflecting their robust performance and adaptability in handling diverse data types.",
      "conclusion": "The evolution of language models from statistical methods to transformer-based architectures embodies significant technological progress. Transformers have established the foundation for state-of-the-art language models like BERT and GPT, driving advances in AI capabilities and expanding practical applications. The future promises continued innovation, particularly with multimodal models and more accessible open-source alternatives."
