      "step1": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1½ teaspoons baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt until evenly combined.",
      "step2": "In a separate mixing bowl, combine 1 cup whole milk, ½ cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes until the mixture is smooth and slightly frothy, then gradually pour in 1 cup boiling water, stirring gently to avoid overmixing.",
      "step3": "Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry mixture, stirring with a spatula until just incorporated. The batter will be thin; this is normal. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula to ensure uniform layers for even baking.",
      "step4": "Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Rotate the pans halfway through baking for even heat distribution. Remove from oven and allow cakes to cool in pans for 10 minutes.",
      "step5": "Run a thin knife around the edges of each cake to loosen them, then invert onto wire racks to cool completely, about 20 minutes. While cooling, prepare the frosting: melt ½ cup butter, stir in ¾ cup cocoa powder, then whisk in 3 cups powdered sugar, ¼ cup milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla until silky.",
      "step6": "Once cakes are fully cooled, place one layer on a serving plate, spread a generous amount of frosting on top, then place the second layer and frost the top and sides evenly. Garnish with chocolate shavings or berries, slice, and serve to eight happy guests."
