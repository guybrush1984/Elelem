Gather all ingredients: 1 and 3/4 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, 1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 and 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 2 tsp vanilla extract, and 1 cup boiling water.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This ensures even distribution of dry ingredients and a smooth batter. Mix well to combine all the dry ingredients thoroughly before adding the wet ingredients.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Add eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes until the batter is smooth and well combined. The mixture will be thick but creamy. This step helps incorporate air for a light cake texture.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Carefully stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but this is normal and helps create a moist cake. Mix until fully combined. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly to ensure uniform baking.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Check doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Avoid overbaking to keep the cake moist and tender.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting or enjoy plain. Slice and serve to 8 guests.\"\n}",
