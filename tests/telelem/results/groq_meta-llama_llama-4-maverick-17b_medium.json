      "introduction": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has been a gradual process, with significant advancements in recent years. Initially, statistical models were used, but with the advent of deep learning, neural networks became the norm. The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, revolutionized the field, enabling the creation of more sophisticated models.",
      "development": "The early 1990s saw the emergence of statistical models for machine translation, while the 2000s brought the rise of corpus-based language modeling. Neural networks were introduced in 2000, and by 2012, deep neural networks were being adapted for language tasks. The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, marked a significant turning point, with BERT and GPT models achieving state-of-the-art results. Since then, LLMs have continued to evolve, with improvements in decoder-only models and the development of multimodal models capable of processing multiple data types. OpenAI's GPT series has been a significant player in this space, with models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 receiving widespread attention. Other models, such as BLOOM and LLaMA, have also been developed, with some being made source-available.",
      "conclusion": "As of 2024, the largest and most capable models are based on the transformer architecture, although some recent implementations have used alternative architectures. The field continues to evolve, with ongoing research and development aimed at improving the capabilities and accessibility of LLMs."
