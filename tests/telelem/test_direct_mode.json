In a large bowl, whisk together 1 \u00be cups flour, 1 \u00be cups sugar, \u00be cup cocoa powder, 1 \u00bd tsp baking soda, 1 \u00bd tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt thoroughly.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate medium bowl, combine 2 large eggs, 1 cup milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Whisk these wet ingredients until well blended and smooth. Ensure all are at room temperature for optimal mixing and cake texture.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry, mixing on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix. Stir in 1 cup of hot water or hot coffee last; this creates a very moist batter. The batter will be thin.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the thin batter evenly between the prepared 8-inch round pans. Place them in the preheated oven. Bake for approximately 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven. Let them cool in their pans on a wire rack for about 10-15 minutes. Then, carefully invert the cakes onto the wire rack to cool completely. Ensure they are fully cooled before frosting.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Prepare your favorite chocolate frosting. Once cakes are completely cool, spread a generous layer of frosting between the two layers and over the top and sides of the cake. Decorate as desired. Slice and serve this delicious chocolate cake for 8!\"\n}\n```",
