      "step1": "Gather ingredients for eight servings: 200g all-purpose flour, 250g sugar, 75g cocoa powder, 1.5 teaspoons baking powder, 1.5 teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon fine salt, 2 large eggs, 240ml whole milk, 120ml neutral oil, 240ml hot coffee, 2 teaspoons vanilla. For ganache: 200g dark chocolate, 240ml heavy cream, 50g butter.",
      "step2": "Preheat oven to 350°F or 180°C. Grease and line two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment; lightly flour. In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to combine and aerate. In a second bowl, whisk eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Set both bowls aside.",
      "step3": "Pour wet ingredients into dry; whisk until mostly smooth. Carefully stream in hot coffee, whisking until batter is glossy and pourable; do not overmix. Divide batter evenly between pans, tapping to release bubbles. Bake immediately to preserve leavening activity and even crumb structure, working quickly but calmly for best results.",
      "step4": "Bake 28 to 32 minutes, rotating halfway, until centers spring back and a toothpick emerges with a few moist crumbs. Cool pans on a rack 10 minutes. Run a knife around edges, invert layers onto the rack, peel parchment, and cool completely before filling, leveling if needed for clean slicing.",
      "step5": "Make ganache: finely chop chocolate into a bowl. Heat cream with butter until steaming; pour over chocolate. Let sit two minutes, then stir until silky. Cool until spreadable. Place one cake layer on a stand, spread ganache, top with second layer, then crumb-coat and chill ten minutes to set frosting.",
      "step6": "Finish frosting: apply remaining ganache smoothly, swirling or leaving rustic swoops. Optionally decorate with shaved chocolate, berries, or flaky salt. Rest 20 minutes to soften, then slice into eight generous wedges. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. Refrigerate leftovers airtight up to four days; bring to room before serving."
