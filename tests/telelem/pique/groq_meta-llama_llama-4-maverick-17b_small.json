Grease two 8-inch round cake pans. Line bottoms with parchment paper. Mix 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In another bowl, whisk 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/2 cup whole milk, 2 large eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and mix until combined. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool in pans for 5 minutes. Transfer cakes to a wire rack to cool completely.\",\n  \"step4\": \"For the frosting, melt 1 cup unsalted butter and 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips in a double boiler. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Whisk in 1 1/2 cups heavy cream until smooth and creamy.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Once cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a thick layer of chocolate frosting on top. Place the second layer on top and frost the entire cake with the remaining frosting.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Decorate as desired with chocolate shavings or chopped nuts. Refrigerate the cake for at least 30 minutes to allow the frosting to set before serving. Slice and serve to your 8 guests.\"\n}\n```",
