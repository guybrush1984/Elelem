      "introduction": "The evolution of large language models (LLMs) began before transformers, with early statistical models like IBM's word alignment techniques and n-gram models achieving state-of-the-art results. The shift to neural networks in the 2000s, spurred by deep learning advances, led to word embeddings and LSTM-based seq2seq models, culminating in Google's 2016 neural machine translation. This set the stage for the transformative introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017.",
      "development": "In 2017, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in \"Attention Is All You Need,\" building on earlier attention mechanisms. This innovation quickly led to BERT in 2018, an encoder-only model that became widely used. However, decoder-only models like GPT gained prominence, with GPT-2 (2019) and GPT-3 (2020) capturing attention for their capabilities and ethical concerns. ChatGPT's 2022 release brought LLMs to the public, boosting research in fields like robotics and software engineering. GPT-4 (2023) offered multimodal abilities without disclosing architecture details, while OpenAI o1 (2024) introduced advanced reasoning. Open-source models like BLOOM, LLaMA, and Mistral AI's offerings expanded access, with DeepSeek R1 (2025) providing a cost-effective alternative. Multimodal LLMs, processing images and audio, emerged post-2023. Though transformers dominate, some recent models use alternative architectures like recurrent networks or Mamba, showcasing ongoing innovation in the field.",
      "conclusion": "LLMs have evolved from statistical methods to advanced neural architectures, with transformers leading current capabilities while new models explore alternative designs."
