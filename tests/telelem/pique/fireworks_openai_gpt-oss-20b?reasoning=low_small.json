In a large bowl whisk together 2 cups all\u2011purpose flour, 1 \u00be cups sugar, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Set aside.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl, combine 1 cup whole milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined; avoid overmixing to keep the batter light.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Tap pans lightly on the counter to release air bubbles. Place in the oven and bake for 25\u201330 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks.\",\n  \"step4\": \"While cakes cool, prepare the frosting: beat \u00bd cup softened butter until creamy. Gradually add 3 cups powdered sugar, \u00bc cup cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2\u20133 tablespoons milk. Beat until fluffy and spreadable, adjusting consistency with more milk or sugar as needed.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Once cakes are completely cooled, level the tops with a serrated knife if necessary. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, spread a generous layer of frosting over the top. Add the second layer, then cover the entire cake with a thin crumb coat of frosting. Chill for 15 minutes to set the crumb coat.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Finish with a final thick layer of frosting, smoothing with a spatula. Decorate with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or fresh berries if desired. Slice, serve, and enjoy the moist, rich chocolate cake with a perfect balance of sweetness and cocoa flavor.\"\n}\n```",
