In a large bowl, whisk together 1.5 cups all-purpose flour, 1.5 cups granulated sugar, 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1.5 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp salt. Ensure all dry ingredients are well combined.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl, combine 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Stir in 1 cup boiling water until the batter is smooth. It will be thin.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Avoid overbaking to maintain moisture. The cakes should spring back lightly when touched.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10-15 minutes. Then, carefully invert them onto a wire rack to cool completely. Ensure they are fully cooled before frosting, otherwise, the frosting will melt and slide off.\",\n  \"step5\": \"For the frosting, beat 1/2 cup softened unsalted butter with 2.5 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1/4 cup milk until smooth and creamy. Add 1 tsp vanilla extract and beat until light and fluffy, adjusting milk for desired consistency.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous amount of frosting evenly over the top. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the entire cake. Decorate as desired and serve for 8 people.\"\n}\n```",
