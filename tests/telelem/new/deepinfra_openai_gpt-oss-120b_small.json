In a large bowl, whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. This dry mix ensures even leavening and texture.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl, combine 1\u202f\u00bd cups granulated sugar, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1\u202fcup melted butter. Beat in 4 large eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract for depth of flavor, mixing thoroughly.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with 1\u202fcup buttermilk. Start and finish with the flour mixture, stirring just until combined to avoid over\u2011mixing. Fold in \u00bd cup melted chocolate chips for extra richness, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Tap the pans gently on the counter to release any air bubbles. Place the pans on the middle rack of the preheated oven, ensuring even heat circulation for uniform baking.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean with a few moist crumbs. Rotate the pans halfway through baking for consistent browning. Once done, remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Transfer the cakes onto a wire rack to cool completely. While cooling, prepare a chocolate ganache by heating \u00bd cup heavy cream and pouring it over 4 ounces chopped dark chocolate. Stir until smooth, then spread between layers and over the top, creating a glossy, decadent finish.\"\n}",
