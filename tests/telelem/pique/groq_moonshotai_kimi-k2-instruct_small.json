Whisk 2 cups flour, 1\u00be cups sugar, \u00be cup cocoa, 1\u00bd tsp baking powder, 1\u00bd tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt. Keep dry mix light and lump-free.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a second bowl, beat 2 eggs until frothy. Stream in 1 cup milk, \u00bd cup oil, 2 tsp vanilla. Blend smoothly. Gradually fold dry mix into wet until just combined; avoid over-mixing to keep crumb tender. Batter will be thick and glossy.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Carefully pour in 1 cup hot coffee, whisking until silky. Batter loosens, deepening chocolate notes. Divide evenly between pans, smoothing tops. Tap pans to release bubbles. This moisture ensures a moist, fudgy cake without sogginess. Work quickly so chemical leaveners stay active.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Bake 30\u201332 minutes, rotating halfway. Test with toothpick: few moist crumbs signal done. Over-baking dries edges. Cool pans on racks 10 minutes; edges pull away slightly. Invert onto racks, peel paper, cool completely. Warm cakes fracture if frosted too soon.\",\n  \"step5\": \"For ganache, simmer 1 cup cream, pour over 8 oz chopped dark chocolate, wait 1 minute, whisk smooth. Chill 20 minutes, beat until spreadable. Slice domes off cakes. Place first layer, spread ganache, add second layer, coat top and sides thinly. Reserve some for swirls.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Chill cake 30 minutes to set. Pipe rosettes with remaining ganache, dust with cocoa. Slice into 8 wedges with warmed knife for clean cuts. Serve at room temperature for fullest flavor. Leftovers keep 3 days covered, or freeze slices up to 1 month.\"\n}",
