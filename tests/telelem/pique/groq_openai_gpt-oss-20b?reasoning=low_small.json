In a large bowl whisk together 1\u00bd cups flour, \u00be cup cocoa powder, 1\u00bd tsp baking soda, \u00bd tsp baking powder, and \u00bd tsp salt. Set aside.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl, beat 1 cup sugar, \u00bd cup butter, and 2 eggs until light and fluffy. Add 1 tsp vanilla extract and mix well. Gradually pour in 1 cup buttermilk, stirring until smooth. Combine wet mixture with dry ingredients, folding gently to avoid lumps.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans. Tap pans lightly on the counter to release air bubbles. Place in the oven and bake for 25\u201330 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool in pans 10 minutes.\",\n  \"step4\": \"While cakes cool, prepare frosting: beat \u00bd cup softened butter until creamy. Gradually add 2 cups powdered sugar, \u00bc cup cocoa powder, 2 tbsp milk, and 1 tsp vanilla. Beat until smooth and spreadable. If frosting is too thick, add a splash more milk.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Once cakes are completely cooled, level tops with a knife if needed. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, spread a generous layer of frosting. Top with the second layer, then apply a thin crumb coat of frosting all around. Chill for 15 minutes to set the crumb coat.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Finish with a final thick layer of frosting, smoothing with a spatula. Decorate with chocolate shavings or sprinkles if desired. Slice, serve, and enjoy a moist, rich chocolate cake perfect for eight guests.\"\n}\n```",
