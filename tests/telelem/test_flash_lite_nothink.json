In a large bowl, whisk together 1 \u00be cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking soda, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl, combine 2 large eggs, 1 cup milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat until well combined. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Carefully stir in 1 cup of boiling water. The batter will be thin; this is normal. This step helps bloom the cocoa powder for a richer chocolate flavor and creates a moist cake.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pan. Tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to release any air bubbles. Ensure the batter is spread to the edges for an even bake.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once completely cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate buttercream or ganache. Slice and serve this decadent chocolate cake, perfect for a gathering of eight. Enjoy the rich, moist texture and deep chocolate flavor!\"\n}\n```",
