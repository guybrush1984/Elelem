In a large bowl whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt, ensuring even distribution for a smooth batter that will rise perfectly later.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Combine wet ingredients in a separate bowl: melt 1 cup (225\u202fg) unsalted butter, then stir in 1\u202f\u00bd cups granulated sugar until creamy. Beat in 4 large eggs one at a time, followed by 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, mixing thoroughly after each addition to ensure rich flavor and moist texture.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the wet butter\u2011sugar blend, stirring gently with a spatula. Pour in \u00be cup (180\u202fml) whole milk and \u00bd cup (120\u202fml) strong brewed coffee, folding until just combined; avoid over\u2011mixing to keep the crumb tender and airy for a delicious chocolate experience every bite.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Tap pans lightly on the counter to release air bubbles. Place in the preheated oven and bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean, indicating doneness and golden brown edges with aroma.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Allow cakes to cool in pans for ten minutes, then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, prepare frosting: melt 200\u202fg dark chocolate with \u00bd cup (115\u202fg) butter over a double boiler, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat, whisk in 2 cups powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons cream.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Spread a thin layer of frosting on the first cake layer, then place the second layer atop. Using a spatula, frost the top and sides generously, creating smooth or rustic swirls as desired. Garnish with chocolate shavings or fresh berries, slice, serve, and enjoy your decadent chocolate masterpiece with joy.\"\n}",
