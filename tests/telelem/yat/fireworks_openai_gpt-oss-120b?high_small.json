Grease two 9\u2011inch round cake pans with butter, then dust lightly with flour, tapping out excess, and ensure they are well\u2011lubricated. Line the bottoms with parchment circles for easy removal. Ensure pans are on the middle rack for even heat distribution during baking properly.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Combine dry components in a large bowl: sift together the all\u2011purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk thoroughly to eliminate lumps, ensuring even distribution of leavening agents. This uniform dry mixture will create a tender crumb, balanced chocolate flavor, and consistent rise throughout the batter perfectly.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Whisk wet ingredients in a separate bowl: beat eggs, then add melted butter, milk, vanilla, and the melted chocolate. Gradually fold the dry mixture into the wet, stirring gently until just combined; over\u2011mixing will develop gluten, resulting in a dense cake texture and a moist crumb that pleases every palate.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Pour batter evenly into prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Place pans on the middle oven rack and bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near the center emerges clean with a few moist crumbs. Rotate pans halfway for uniform browning and a golden crust forms perfectly.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Allow cakes to cool in pans for ten minutes, then invert onto wire racks to cool completely. While cooling, prepare frosting: beat butter until fluffy, add powdered sugar, cocoa, milk, and vanilla, mixing until smooth. Spread frosting between layers and over the top, then garnish with chocolate shavings for elegance.\"\n}",
