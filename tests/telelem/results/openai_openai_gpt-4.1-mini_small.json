      "step1": "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan to prevent sticking. Prepare your ingredients: 1 and 3/4 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt.",
      "step2": "In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of all the ingredients. This will give your chocolate cake a perfect rise and balanced sweetness.",
      "step3": "Add wet ingredients to the dry mix: 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat on medium speed until smooth. Gradually add 1 cup boiling water, mixing carefully to create a thin batter—this makes the cake moist and rich.",
      "step4": "Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Check doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center; it should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs.",
      "step5": "Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool completely. This cooling step prevents the cake from becoming soggy and helps in frosting application.",
      "step6": "Frost your cooled cake with chocolate buttercream or ganache. To make buttercream, beat butter, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and a touch of milk until fluffy. Spread evenly on the cake. Decorate as desired with sprinkles or chocolate shavings for a delightful chocolate experience."
