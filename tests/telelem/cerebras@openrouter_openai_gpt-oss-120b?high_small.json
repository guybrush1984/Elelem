Grease two 9\u2011inch round cake pans with butter and dust with flour, tapping out excess. In a large bowl whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until uniform. Set aside for later mixing while you whisk the milk, oil, and eggs.\",\n  \"step3\": \"In a separate container, beat eight eggs with sugar until pale and fluffy. Gradually add milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla, mixing continuously. Slowly pour the dry cocoa\u2011flour mixture into the wet batter, stirring gently. Finally incorporate one cup boiling water, creating a thin, glossy batter ready for baking right now.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Place pans on a middle rack, ensuring space for air circulation. Bake for thirty\u2011five minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near the center emerges clean, signaling a moist, fully cooked crumb. Remove from oven promptly and cool.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Allow cakes to cool in pans for ten minutes, then invert onto wire racks to reach room temperature. Meanwhile, prepare frosting by whisking powdered sugar, cocoa powder, softened butter, milk, and vanilla until silky smooth. Spread a generous layer between layers, then coat sides and top evenly for perfect texture.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Slice the chocolate cake into eight equal pieces, using a sharp knife warmed in hot water for clean cuts. Arrange slices on dessert plates, dusting each with a light sprinkling of cocoa powder or powdered sugar. Garnish with fresh berries or mint leaves for added freshness and visual appeal today.\"\n}",
