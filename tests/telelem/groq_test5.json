In a medium bowl whisk together 1\u00bd cups flour, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Set aside for the dry mix.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup sugar, \u00bd cup melted butter, and 2 eggs. Beat on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and \u00bd cup milk. Pour this wet mixture over the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Fold in 1 cup boiling water slowly; batter will be thin. Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Tap the pans gently on the counter to release air bubbles and level the batter for even baking.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Bake in the preheated oven for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Remove from oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\",\n  \"step5\": \"While cakes cool, whisk 1 cup powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons butter, \u00bc cup cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2\u20133 tablespoons milk until smooth. Adjust consistency by adding more milk or powdered sugar. Chill frosting in the fridge for 10 minutes to firm up slightly.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once cakes are cool, level tops with a knife if uneven. Place one layer on a cake plate, spread a thin layer of frosting, top with the second layer, and apply a crumb coat. Chill for 10 minutes, then finish with a generous swirl of frosting and chocolate shavings for a decadent finish.\"\n}\n```",
