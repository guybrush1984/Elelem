      "introduction": "Before transformer-based models emerged in 2017, language modeling was dominated by statistical techniques such as IBM’s word alignment for machine translation and n‑gram models with smoothing that achieved state‑of‑the‑art perplexities on modest corpora. With the internet boom in the 2000s, researchers began harvesting vast web corpora, enabling larger statistical models. Around 2000, neural networks entered the scene, and by 2012 deep learning breakthroughs in vision were adapted to language tasks, leading to word embeddings, LSTMs, and eventually neural machine translation. This set the stage for the 2017 transformer, a pivotal shift from recurrent to attention‑driven architectures.",
      "development": "The transformer, introduced at NeurIPS 2017 in \"Attention Is All You Need,\" replaced the encoder‑decoder LSTMs of prior NMT systems by leveraging multi‑head self‑attention and feed‑forward layers, eliminating recurrence and enabling massively parallel training. In 2018, BERT, an encoder‑only variant, became ubiquitous for representation learning, though its academic usage waned by 2023 as decoder‑only models gained prominence. GPT‑1 (2018) and GPT‑2 (2019) demonstrated the power of large autoregressive transformers; GPT‑2’s delayed release due to safety concerns highlighted the potential for misuse. GPT‑3 (2020) pushed the envelope with 175B parameters, but was only offered via API, setting a precedent for commercial deployment. The 2022 ChatGPT chatbot captured public attention, illustrating how prompting could unlock complex reasoning without fine‑tuning. GPT‑4 (2023), though shrouded in secrecy regarding its architecture and scale, earned acclaim for its multimodal capabilities and accuracy, cementing transformer dominance. OpenAI’s 2024 o1 model introduced a chain‑of‑thought style reasoning, further enhancing interpretability. Concurrently, open‑weight models like BLOOM, LLaMA, and Mistral’s permissively licensed 7B and Mixtral 8x7B attracted researchers seeking reproducibility. In early 2025, DeepSeek R1 released a 671‑billion‑parameter open‑weight model matching o1’s performance at lower cost, showcasing the rapid scaling of transformer‑based LLMs. Meanwhile, multimodal LLMs (LMMs) emerged, combining text, image, and audio modalities, expanding applications across robotics, software engineering, and societal impact studies. Though transformers remain the backbone, experimental architectures such as recurrent variants and Mamba (a state‑space model) hint at possible future diversification of large‑model designs.",
      "conclusion": "Transformers have revolutionized language modeling, enabling unprecedented scale and versatility. As open‑weight and multimodal models proliferate, the field balances innovation with ethical considerations, steering toward more accessible yet responsible AI systems."
