      "introduction": "Prior to transformer-based breakthroughs in 2017, language modeling relied on statistical and early neural techniques that pushed the limits of the era’s resources. IBM’s 1990s statistical models introduced word alignment, while smoothed n‑gram models in the early 2000s set perplexity records on large corpora. The web’s explosion enabled massive datasets, and by the 2010s, neural word embeddings and LSTM‑based sequence models began to eclipse n‑grams. The pivotal 2017 \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper launched transformer architectures, leading to ubiquitous models such as BERT and the GPT series. This evolution culminated in 2024’s multimodal and open‑weight large language models, redefining the field’s research and application landscape.",
      "development": "In the early 1990s, IBM pioneered statistical models that enabled word alignment for machine translation, laying the groundwork for corpus‑based language modeling. By 2001, smoothed n‑gram models employing techniques like Kneser–Ney, trained on 300 million words, achieved state‑of‑the‑art perplexity on benchmarks. The rise of the internet in the 2000s allowed researchers to harvest massive text datasets from the web—coined \"web as corpus\"—to train larger statistical language models. Meanwhile, starting in 2000, neural networks began to learn language representations, a trend accelerated by breakthroughs in deep learning for image classification around 2012. This shift saw the advent of word embeddings such as Word2Vec (2013) and sequence‑to‑sequence (seq2seq) models using LSTM units. In 2016, Google moved its translation service to neural machine translation (NMT), replacing statistical phrase‑based models with deep recurrent neural networks. These early NMT systems employed LSTM‑based encoder‑decoder architectures and predated transformers.\n\nThe transformative moment came at the 2017 NeurIPS conference, when Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in \"Attention Is All You Need,\" aiming to improve upon 2014 seq2seq models. The transformer’s key innovation was the self‑attention mechanism, which allowed parallel processing of tokens and eliminated recurrent dependencies. A year later, 2018 saw the introduction of BERT, an encoder‑only transformer that quickly became ubiquitous in academia. Although academic usage of BERT waned by 2023, decoder‑only models such as GPT surged, with GPT‑1 (2018), GPT‑2 (2019) capturing public attention due to its size and potential misuse, and GPT‑3 (2020) becoming available only via API. The 2022 release of ChatGPT and the 2023 GPT‑4, praised for multimodal capabilities, spurred widespread LLM adoption across robotics, software engineering, and societal impact research.\n\nIn 2024, OpenAI launched the reasoning model o1, which generates long chains of thought before answering. Concurrently, source‑available models such as BLOOM, LLaMA, and the more permissive Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B gained popularity. January 2025 saw DeepSeek release R1, a 671‑billion‑parameter open‑weight model rivaling OpenAI o1 at lower cost. Since 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, processing images, audio, and text—earning the designation large multimodal models (LMMs). While transformers remain the dominant architecture, recent implementations explore alternative structures like recurrent neural network variants and Mamba, a state‑space model. The current landscape showcases a diversity of large, multimodal, and open‑weight models, each pushing the boundaries of language understanding and generation.",
      "conclusion": "The trajectory from statistical n‑grams to transformer‑based, multimodal large language models reflects a relentless drive for richer representation and broader applicability, reshaping research, industry, and society alike."
