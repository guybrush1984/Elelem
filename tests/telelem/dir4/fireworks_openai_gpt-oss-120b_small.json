In a large bowl whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt, ensuring distribution to ensure a light crumb and moist texture throughout perfectly.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Combine wet ingredients in a separate bowl: beat 4 large eggs, then add 1\u202fcup whole milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract. Mix until smooth, then gradually whisk in 1\u202fcup boiling water, creating a thin batter that will give richness and moisture for a moist crumb.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Tap the pans lightly on the counter to release air bubbles. Place them in the preheated oven, baking for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean and a golden crust forms.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Allow cakes to cool in pans for 10 minutes, then run a thin knife around edges and invert onto wire racks. Let them cool completely, about 1 hour, before frosting. Meanwhile, prepare chocolate ganache by heating 1\u202fcup heavy cream to simmer, then pouring over 8 ounces chopped dark chocolate smoothly.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Whisk ganache until glossy and slightly thickened, then let it sit until it reaches a spreadable consistency, about 5 minutes. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, spread half of the ganache evenly over the surface, then top with the second layer, reserving remaining ganache for frosting on top.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Finally, drizzle the remaining ganache over the top, allowing it to cascade down the sides for a glossy finish. Garnish with shaved chocolate or fresh berries if desired. Slice, serve, and enjoy the rich, moist chocolate cake, perfect for gatherings of eight hungry guests at the celebration tonight together forever.\"\n}",
