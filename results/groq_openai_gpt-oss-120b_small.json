      "step1": "Gather ingredients: 2½ cups flour, 2 cups sugar, ¾ cup cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1½ tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 cup buttermilk, ½ cup oil, 2 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1 cup boiling water. Preheat oven to 350°F and grease three 8‑inch pans.",
      "step2": "In a large bowl whisk dry ingredients—flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt—until fully combined. In another bowl beat wet ingredients—buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla—until smooth. Gradually pour wet mixture into dry, stirring gently until batter is uniform, then stir in boiling water.",
      "step3": "Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Tap pans lightly on the counter to release air bubbles. Place them on the middle rack of the oven, ensuring even spacing for uniform heat distribution.",
      "step4": "Bake for 30‑35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Rotate pans halfway through baking for even browning. Once done, remove from oven and set on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.",
      "step5": "Run a thin knife around the edges of each cake to loosen. Carefully invert onto the rack, peel off parchment, and let fully cool for 20 minutes. While cooling, prepare a chocolate ganache by heating cream and pouring over chopped dark chocolate, stirring until glossy.",
      "step6": "Level the cake layers with a serrated knife. Spread a thin coat of ganache between each layer, then frost the entire cake with remaining ganache, smoothing edges. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to set, then serve slices to eight guests and enjoy."
