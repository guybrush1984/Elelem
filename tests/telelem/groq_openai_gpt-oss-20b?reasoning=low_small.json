Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and grease an 8\u2011inch round pan.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large bowl whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in milk and vanilla until combined.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually fold the dry mixture into the wet batter until smooth. Gently stir in the melted chocolate until evenly distributed, then slowly pour in the boiling water, mixing just until batter is glossy and runny. Fold in nuts if using, reserving a handful for topping.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the surface with a spatula. Tap the pan lightly to release air pockets. Bake for 35\u201140 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs but no wet batter.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Remove from oven, allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, use a knife to level the top if uneven and roll your favorite frosting or drizzle with chocolate ganache.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Garnish with the reserved nuts, a dusting of powdered sugar, or fresh berries. Slice, serve, and enjoy a rich, moist chocolate cake perfect for eight guests or a celebratory treat.\"\n}",
