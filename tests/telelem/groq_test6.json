In a mixing bowl, whisk together 1\u00bd cups flour, \u00be cup cocoa powder, 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Set aside the dry mix.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate saucepan, combine 1 cup water, 1 cup milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 eggs. Heat until the mixture is warm, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, add 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and \u00bc cup melted butter. Let it cool slightly before adding to dry ingredients.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Pour the wet mixture into the dry batter, whisking until smooth and glossy. Gently fold in 1 cup of boiling water to create a light, airy batter. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pan, tap lightly to release any air pockets, and smooth the surface.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Avoid overbaking to keep the cake moist. While baking, preheat a small saucepan for the ganache: whisk 8 ounces dark chocolate chips with \u00bc cup heavy cream until silky.\",\n  \"step5\": \"When the cake is done, let it rest in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, pour the warm ganache over the cake, allowing it to pool slightly at the edges for a decadent finish.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Slice the cake into 8 equal portions, serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a drizzle of raspberry coulis. Enjoy the rich, moist chocolate experience with a cup of your favorite beverage.\"\n}\n```",
