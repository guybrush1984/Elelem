In a large bowl, whisk together 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate medium bowl, combine all your wet ingredients. Lightly beat 2 large eggs, then stir in 1 cup of buttermilk, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract until everything is well combined. This mixture provides moisture and richness for a tender cake.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients mixture. Mix on low speed until just combined, then carefully pour in 1 cup of boiling hot water or strong black coffee. The batter will be thin. Mix until smooth. The hot liquid helps to bloom the cocoa for a richer flavor.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the batter evenly between your two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for about 10 minutes.\",\n  \"step5\": \"After 10 minutes, carefully invert the cakes onto the wire rack, remove the pans, and let them cool completely. While the cakes cool, prepare your favorite chocolate frosting. A classic chocolate buttercream works wonderfully. Ensure cakes are fully cooled before frosting to prevent it from melting off the sides.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Place one cake layer on a serving platter and spread a thick layer of frosting over the top. Place the second layer on top of the first. Use the remaining frosting to cover the top and sides of the entire cake. Decorate as desired before slicing and serving to your guests.\"\n}\n```",
