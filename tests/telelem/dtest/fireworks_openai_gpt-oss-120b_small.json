In a large bowl whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, 1\u202f\u00bd teaspoons salt, and \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder for richness.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Combine wet ingredients in a separate bowl: beat 1 cup melted butter with 2 cups granulated sugar until fluffy, then add 4 large eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 1 cup buttermilk, creating a smooth, glossy batter for optimal texture.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet batter, folding gently with a spatula to avoid over\u2011mixing. Pour half of the batter into each prepared pan, smoothing the tops. Sprinkle \u00bc cup chocolate chips over each layer for extra moisture and a burst of chocolate flavor in every bite today.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Place the pans on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean with a few moist crumbs. Rotate the pans halfway through baking for even browning and consistent rise ensuring a perfect texture throughout the cake layers.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then run a thin knife around the edges, invert onto wire racks, and peel off parchment. Allow cakes to cool completely before frosting, ensuring structural stability for layered assembly in the final presentation stage.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Prepare a silky chocolate ganache: heat 1 cup heavy cream until simmering, then pour over 8 ounces chopped dark chocolate, stirring until glossy. Frost the cooled cakes with a generous layer, then pipe decorative swirls. Refrigerate 20 minutes, slice, and serve each generous piece with a smile for every guest.\"\n}",
