In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and \u00be teaspoon salt. In a separate bowl, sift 1\u202f\u00be cups granulated sugar, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1\u202f\u00bd teaspoons espresso powder for depth.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In another bowl, combine 1\u202fcup buttermilk, \u00bd cup warm water, \u00bc cup vegetable oil, and 2 large eggs at room temperature. Whisk until smooth, then stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients, mixing gently to avoid over\u2011development of gluten, creating a thick batter.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Melt \u00bd cup unsalted butter and \u00bd cup dark chocolate together over a simmering pot, stirring until glossy. Allow to cool slightly, then fold the chocolate mixture into the batter, ensuring an even swirl without deflating the batter. This adds richness and a deep chocolate flavor.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Grease three 8\u2011inch round cake pans with butter and line with parchment circles. Divide the batter evenly among the pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Tap pans gently on the counter to release any trapped air bubbles, promoting an even crumb structure.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Bake for 25\u201130 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean with a few moist crumbs. Rotate pans halfway for uniform baking. Remove from oven, let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto wire racks to cool completely.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Prepare a chocolate ganache by heating 1\u202fcup heavy cream to a simmer, then pouring over 8\u202foz chopped semi\u2011sweet chocolate. Stir until smooth, let thicken slightly, and spread between cake layers. Frost the exterior, garnish with chocolate shavings, and serve eight generous slices.\"\n}",
