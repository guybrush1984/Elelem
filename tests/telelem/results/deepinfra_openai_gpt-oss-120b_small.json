      "step1": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9‑inch round cake pans, then line the bottoms with parchment paper. In a large bowl whisk together 2 ½ cups all‑purpose flour, 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder, ½ teaspoon baking soda, and ½ teaspoon salt to ensure even texture and rise throughout.",
      "step2": "In another bowl, combine 1 ¾ cups granulated sugar, ¾ cup packed brown sugar, and 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder. Add 1 ½ cups melted butter, then whisk in 4 large eggs, one at a time, beating until smooth and glossy. Then add 1 teaspoon vanilla and half cup coffee for richness.",
      "step3": "Gradually fold the dry flour mixture into the chocolate batter, alternating with 1 cup whole milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture, mixing just until no streaks remain. The batter will be thick but smooth, ready for filling and frosting later. Make sure avoid overmixing keep it airy properly.",
      "step4": "Pour half of the batter into each prepared pan, spreading evenly. Drop spoonfuls of ½ cup chopped dark chocolate and ¼ cup toasted walnuts over the surface, then gently swirl with a skewer for marble effect. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt on top to enhance flavor and texture contrast.",
      "step5": "Bake cakes for 30‑35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near center emerges with just a few moist crumbs. Let them cool in pans ten minutes, then turn onto wire racks to cool completely. Meanwhile, prepare chocolate ganache for frosting by heating 1 cup cream and 8 ounces melted chocolate.",
      "step6": "Once cakes are fully cooled, spread a generous layer of ganache between layers, then coat the top and sides. Chill for 15 minutes to set. Garnish with additional chopped walnuts and drizzle extra ganache. Serve at room temperature, slicing with a warm knife for clean cuts and enjoy rich flavor."
