In a large bowl whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt, and ensure the mixture is evenly combined thoroughly.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In another bowl, beat 1\u202f\u00bd cups granulated sugar and \u00be cup softened butter until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add 4 large eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, then set aside to let flavors meld before mixing with dry.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the butter\u2011sugar blend, alternating with 1 cup whole milk. Begin with flour, then milk, and repeat, ending with flour. Mix each addition just until incorporated, avoiding over\u2011mixing to keep the cake tender. This method preserves air bubbles, ensuring a light, fluffy crumb throughout.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Tap pans lightly on the counter to release air pockets. Sprinkle \u00bc cup chocolate chips over each surface for extra richness, then gently fold them into the batter with a swift motion, ensuring they are well distributed throughout.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Place pans in the preheated oven on the middle rack. Bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean with only moist crumbs. Rotate pans halfway through baking for even browning, then remove from oven and cool on racks for ten minutes before frosting cakes.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Run a thin knife around each cake\u2019s edge to release it, then invert onto plates. Frost with a silky chocolate ganache: melt 200\u202fg dark chocolate with 100\u202fml heavy cream, stir until glossy. Pipe ganache between layers, then drizzle over the top, garnish with shaved chocolate for added texture and appeal.\"\n}",
