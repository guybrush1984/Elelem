Proper pan preparation is key for a perfect cake release.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large bowl, whisk together 1 \u00be cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking soda, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt. Ensure everything is well combined for an even texture.\",\n  \"step3\": \"In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 large eggs, 1 cup milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Pour these wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Avoid overmixing the batter.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Carefully stir in 1 cup of boiling water or hot brewed coffee into the batter. Mix until smooth; the batter will be thin.

Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Allow cakes to cool completely on the wire rack. Once cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting or ganache. This rich, moist chocolate cake is perfect for serving 8 people a generous slice each.\"\n}\n```",
