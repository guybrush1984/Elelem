      "step1": "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan, line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release. In a large bowl, sift together 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 cups granulated sugar, 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder, 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well to combine evenly.",
      "step2": "In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup whole milk, ½ cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract until smooth and homogenous. Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined; avoid overmixing to keep the batter light.",
      "step3": "Fold in 1 cup boiling water slowly, which creates a silky batter and activates the cocoa. The batter will be thin; this is normal. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to thicken slightly, ensuring an airy crumb when baked and a moist texture throughout.",
      "step4": "Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Tap the pan gently on the counter to remove any air pockets, then slide the pan onto the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes, checking with a toothpick inserted in the center—if it comes out clean, the cake is ready.",
      "step5": "Remove from oven and let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely. While cooling, prepare a simple ganache: heat 1 cup heavy cream to a simmer, pour over 8 ounces chopped dark chocolate, stir until glossy, then spread evenly over the cooled cake.",
      "step6": "Once the ganache has set to a firm but spreadable consistency, slice the cake into eight equal portions. Serve at room temperature, optionally garnishing with fresh berries or a dusting of powdered sugar. Enjoy a rich, moist chocolate cake shared with friends and family!"
