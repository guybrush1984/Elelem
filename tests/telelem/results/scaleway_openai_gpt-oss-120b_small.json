      "step1": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease three 9‑inch round cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper. In a large bowl whisk together 2 ½ cups all‑purpose flour, 2 ½ cups granulated sugar, 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and 1 ½ teaspoons salt for mixing",
      "step2": "In another container, combine 1 cup buttermilk, 1 cup warm water, ½ cup vegetable oil, and 2 large eggs. Whisk until smooth, then stir in 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract. Slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, folding gently until just combined, avoiding over‑mixing for optimal texture and moisture",
      "step3": "Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Tap pans lightly on countertop to release air bubbles. Bake for 30‑35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean with a few moist crumbs attached from the cake layers ensuring even baking throughout",
      "step4": "Allow cakes to cool in pans for 10 minutes, then run a thin knife around edges and invert onto wire racks. Peel parchment paper, letting cakes cool completely. Meanwhile, prepare frosting by melting 200 g dark chocolate with ½ cup heavy cream over a bain‑marie, stirring until silky and glossy finish",
      "step5": "Whip 1 cup softened butter until light and fluffy, then gradually add the cooled chocolate ganache, mixing on medium speed. Incorporate 2 cups powdered sugar, a pinch of salt, and 1 teaspoon espresso powder for depth. Beat until the frosting is smooth, glossy, and spreadable for even layering on the cake slices",
      "step6": "Place one cake layer on a serving plate, spread a generous dollop of frosting, then top with second layer and repeat, finishing with the third layer. Frost the sides and top, creating smooth swirls. Garnish with chocolate shavings and serve, enjoying moist, rich chocolate indulgence with family and friends today"
