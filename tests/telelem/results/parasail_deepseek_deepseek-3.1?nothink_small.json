      "step1": "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, whisk together 1 3/4 cups flour, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, 2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt.",
      "step2": "Add 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and 2 tsp vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed until just combined. Gradually pour in 1 cup boiling water and stir until the batter is smooth and thin.",
      "step3": "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack.",
      "step4": "While the cakes cool, make the frosting. Cream 1/2 cup softened butter until smooth. Gradually beat in 2/3 cup cocoa powder, then alternate adding 3 cups powdered sugar and 1/3 cup milk, beating until smooth and spreadable.",
      "step5": "Once the cakes are completely cool, level the tops if needed. Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a layer of frosting over it. Top with the second cake layer and frost the top and sides evenly.",
      "step6": "Decorate with chocolate shavings or sprinkles if desired. Let the cake set for at least 30 minutes before slicing. Serve at room temperature and store any leftovers covered at room temperature for up to 3 days. Enjoy!"
