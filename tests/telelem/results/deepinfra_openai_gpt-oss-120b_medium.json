      "introduction": "The evolution of language modeling has progressed from early statistical approaches in the 1990s to the dominant transformer‑based architectures of the 2020s. Initial work on word alignment and smoothed n‑gram models laid the groundwork for large‑scale corpora, while the 2000s saw the rise of neural networks and word embeddings. The pivotal shift occurred in 2017 with the introduction of the transformer, which rapidly supplanted recurrent models and enabled the development of powerful encoder‑only and decoder‑only systems such as BERT and GPT. Recent years have been marked by explosive growth in model size, multimodal capabilities, and open‑source alternatives.",
      "development": "In the early 1990s IBM’s statistical models introduced word alignment techniques that became the foundation for corpus‑based language modeling. By 2001, smoothed n‑gram models trained on hundreds of millions of words achieved state‑of‑the‑art perplexity, and the expanding internet provided massive web corpora for statistical models throughout the 2000s. Around 2000 researchers began applying neural networks to language modeling, and after the 2012 breakthrough in deep vision models, similar deep architectures were adapted for text. Word2Vec (2013) and LSTM‑based seq2seq models enabled the first neural machine translation (NMT) systems, with Google deploying LSTM encoders‑decoders in 2016. The 2017 NeurIPS paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" introduced the transformer, replacing recurrence with multi‑head attention and layer normalization, and quickly became the standard. BERT (2018) demonstrated the power of encoder‑only transformers for a wide range of tasks, though its academic popularity waned by 2023 as decoder‑only models like GPT‑3 and GPT‑4 showed superior zero‑shot prompting abilities. GPT‑2 (2019) sparked debate over model misuse, and GPT‑3 (2020) and GPT‑4 (2023) cemented the API‑only deployment model, with GPT‑4 praised for multimodal reasoning despite undisclosed architecture details. The release of ChatGPT (2022) drove mainstream adoption, influencing fields from robotics to software engineering. OpenAI’s 2024 o1 model added explicit chain‑of‑thought reasoning. Parallel to proprietary systems, open‑weight models such as BLOOM, LLaMA, Mistral, Mixtral, and DeepSeek R1 (2025, 671 B parameters) emerged under permissive licenses, offering comparable performance at lower cost. Since 2023, many LLMs have become multimodal (LMMs), processing images, audio, and text. While transformers remain the dominant architecture, alternative designs like recurrent variants and the state‑space Mamba model have also been explored in recent implementations.",
      "conclusion": "Overall, the field has moved from modest statistical models to massive, versatile transformers, with open‑source and multimodal initiatives shaping the next generation of language technologies."
