      "step1": "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans. Sift together 2 cups flour, 1¾ cups sugar, ¾ cup cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt into a large bowl.",
      "step2": "Add 2 large eggs, 1 cup buttermilk, ½ cup vegetable oil, and 2 tsp vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed until just combined. Gradually add 1 cup boiling water, mixing until smooth—batter will be thin.",
      "step3": "Divide batter evenly between prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool cakes in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.",
      "step4": "For frosting, beat 1 cup softened butter until creamy. Gradually add 4 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt. Mix on low until combined, then increase speed to medium.",
      "step5": "Add ½ cup milk and 2 tsp vanilla extract to frosting. Beat on high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. If too thick, add more milk; if too thin, add more powdered sugar until spreadable consistency.",
      "step6": "Place one cake layer on a plate. Spread with frosting. Top with second layer. Frost top and sides. Decorate with chocolate shavings or sprinkles if desired. Chill for 30 minutes before slicing. Serves 8."
