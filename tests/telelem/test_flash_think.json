Also, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup oil, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup boiling water. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round pans.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Ensure all dry ingredients are thoroughly combined and free of lumps. This initial dry mix provides the foundation for the cake's structure and rich chocolate flavor. Set aside.\",\n  \"step3\": \"In a separate medium bowl, combine the milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract. Whisk these wet ingredients together until they are smooth and well-incorporated. This mixture will add essential moisture and richness to your cake, contributing to a tender, delicious crumb.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until just combined. Gradually add the cup of boiling water (or hot coffee) to the batter, mixing until smooth. The batter will be quite thin, which is perfectly normal for a moist chocolate cake.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Divide the thin batter evenly between the two prepared 8-inch cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. The cakes should be springy to the touch. Avoid overbaking to ensure optimal moisture.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Let the cakes cool in their pans on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes before inverting them onto the rack to cool completely. Once fully cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate ganache, buttercream, or cream cheese frosting. Slice and serve your delicious cake for 8!\"\n}\n```",
