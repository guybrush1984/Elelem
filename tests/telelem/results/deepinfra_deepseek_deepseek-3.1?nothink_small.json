      "step1": "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans. In a bowl, whisk together 2 cups flour, 1¾ cups sugar, ¾ cup cocoa, 2 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp salt.",
      "step2": "Add 2 large eggs, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 cup strong coffee (cooled), ½ cup vegetable oil, and 2 tsp vanilla to dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Batter will be thin.",
      "step3": "Pour batter evenly into prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks.",
      "step4": "While cakes cool, make frosting: Beat 1 cup softened butter until creamy. Gradually add 3½ cups powdered sugar, 1 cup cocoa, and a pinch of salt. Mix until combined.",
      "step5": "Add ½ cup milk and 2 tsp vanilla to frosting. Beat on high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. If too thick, add more milk; if too thin, add more powdered sugar.",
      "step6": "Place one cake layer on a plate. Spread with frosting. Top with second layer. Frost top and sides. Chill for 30 minutes before serving. Enjoy your rich chocolate cake!"
