In a large bowl, whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. This dry mix ensures even leavening.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl, combine 1\u202f\u00bd cups granulated sugar, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1\u202fcup melted butter. Beat until smooth, then add 4 large eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. The mixture should become glossy and slightly thickened.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually stir the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, alternating with 1\u202fcup buttermilk. Begin and end with the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Over\u2011mixing can toughen the crumb, so stop once the batter is uniform and no flour streaks remain.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Fold in 1\u202f\u00bd teaspoons vanilla extract and 1\u202fcup semi\u2011sweet chocolate chips for bursts of flavor. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Tap the pans gently on the counter to release any trapped air bubbles.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean or with a few moist crumbs. Rotate the pans halfway through baking for even browning. Once done, let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Prepare a simple chocolate frosting by beating \u00bd cup softened butter, 2\u202fcups powdered sugar, \u00bc cup cocoa powder, 2\u202ftablespoons heavy cream, and a pinch of salt until fluffy. Frost the top of one cake layer, place the second layer on top, and finish frosting the sides. Serve and enjoy!\"\n}",
