      "introduction": "Before transformers emerged in 2017, language modeling evolved through statistical and neural approaches. Early efforts in the 1990s—such as IBM’s statistical word-alignment models—established corpus-based methods for machine translation. In 2001, smoothed n‑gram models trained on hundreds of millions of words achieved leading perplexity scores. The 2000s saw the web become a vast training corpus. Neural language modeling began around 2000 and accelerated after deep networks succeeded in vision. Word embeddings and LSTM sequence‑to‑sequence models replaced many earlier methods, and by 2016 Google had adopted neural machine translation for its service. These developments set the stage for attention‑based architectures that followed.",
      "development": "Transformers, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, replaced recurrent architectures by relying primarily on multiheaded self‑attention and positional encodings to model long‑range dependencies without recurrence. The attention mechanism built on earlier alignment work and led quickly to powerful encoder and decoder block variants. In 2018, BERT demonstrated the effectiveness of encoder‑only pretraining across tasks, becoming ubiquitous in research and applications until decoder‑only prompting techniques later shifted attention toward generative models. OpenAI’s GPT line illustrated that large decoder‑only transformers could be scaled to deliver few‑shot and zero‑shot performance: GPT‑1 appeared in 2018, GPT‑2 (2019) attracted public attention for perceived misuse risks, and GPT‑3 (2020) offered dramatic increases in capability accessed via API. ChatGPT, released in 2022, popularized conversational interfaces and greatly increased public awareness. GPT‑4 (2023) improved accuracy and introduced multimodal processing; OpenAI did not disclose its architecture or parameter count. Research activity surged across fields such as robotics, software engineering, and societal impact studies. New training paradigms emerged, including models designed to generate explicit chains of thought, exemplified by OpenAI o1 in 2024. Since 2022 a variety of source‑available and open‑weight initiatives expanded access. BLOOM and LLaMA popularized research‑friendly weights though often with use restrictions; Mistral released permissively licensed models like Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b. In 2025 DeepSeek published DeepSeek R1, a 671‑billion‑parameter open‑weight model with performance comparable to high‑end commercial systems at lower cost. From 2023 many models were trained multimodally to handle images or audio, creating large multimodal models (LMMs). While transformers dominate state‑of‑the‑art scaling, alternative architectures — including recurrent variants and state‑space models like Mamba — have reappeared in exploration and niche implementations. Overall, the field progressed from statistical n‑gram systems and web‑scale corpora to neural and attention‑based models, with continual emphasis on scale, data, licensing, and multimodality, and deployment considerations across industry and academia.",
      "conclusion": "Transformer architectures transformed language modeling by enabling scalable attention‑based learning, spawning influential encoder and decoder families like BERT and GPT. Since then, models diversified into open‑weight offerings, multimodal systems, and alternative architectures. Ongoing priorities include scaling, responsible use, openness, and extending capabilities across modalities and application domains for broader benefit."
