In a large bowl, whisk together 2\u202f\u00bd cups all\u2011purpose flour, 2\u202f\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, and \u00bd teaspoon salt for balanced flavor and texture. Ready.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Combine wet ingredients in a separate mixing bowl: beat 1 cup softened butter until creamy, then add 2 cups granulated sugar, whisking until fluffy. Incorporate 4 large eggs one at a time, followed by 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, mixing thoroughly after each addition to ensure smooth consistency throughout the.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed until just combined. Pour in 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 cup buttermilk, and \u00bd cup hot water, stirring gently to create a glossy, thick batter without overmixing, preserving tenderness for optimal rise and moisture. Enjoy.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing tops with a spatula. Tap the pans lightly on the counter to release any trapped air bubbles. Place them in the preheated oven, baking for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean and golden brown color.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Remove the cakes from the oven, allowing them to cool in the pans for ten minutes. Then run a thin knife around the edges, invert onto a wire rack, and peel off parchment. Let the layers cool completely before frosting, ensuring the surface is dry for a smooth finish today.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Prepare the chocolate frosting: melt \u00bd cup butter, \u00be cup dark chocolate, and \u00bc cup cream together over low heat. Whisk in 2 cups powdered sugar and a pinch of salt until silky. Spread frosting generously between layers, over the top, and around the sides, then chill briefly before serving.\"\n}",
