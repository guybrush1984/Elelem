Gather your ingredients: 1 and 3/4 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, 1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 and 1/2 tsp baking soda, and salt.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients thoroughly. In another bowl, mix 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and 2 tsp vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring until smooth with no lumps.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Slowly stir in 1 cup boiling water to the batter to enhance moisture and chocolate flavor; the batter will be thin, but that\u2019s normal. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pan, ensuring the surface is smooth and distributed evenly for uniform baking.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Check doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center\u2014it should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Avoid over-baking to keep the cake moist and tender.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Remove the cake from oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it onto a wire rack to cool completely. Cooling allows the cake structure to set, making it easier to frost without crumbling.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once cool, frost with chocolate buttercream or your favorite frosting. To make buttercream, beat 1/2 cup butter, gradually add 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, and 1 tsp vanilla, mixing until smooth. Spread evenly and enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake!\"\n}",
