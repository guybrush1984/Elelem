      "introduction": "The evolution of large language models (LLMs) has been marked by significant milestones, driven by advances in computational power, data availability, and algorithmic innovation. Before transformers revolutionized the field in 2017, earlier approaches leveraged statistical methods and neural networks for language modeling and translation tasks. The transformer architecture, along with advancements like BERT and GPT, dramatically improved performance and versatility in natural language processing, spurring rapid growth, new applications, and open competition among model providers.",
      "development": "Early language models, such as those developed by IBM in the 1990s, applied statistical techniques to machine translation, utilizing corpus-based approaches. The 2000s ushered in the era of the internet-scale datasets, with n-gram models, particularly those enhanced by techniques like Kneser–Ney smoothing, achieving strong results with ever-larger corpora. Around 2000, neural networks began to be explored for language modeling, catalyzed by deep learning successes in computer vision around 2012. This led to the introduction of word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec in 2013) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, which Google incorporated into its neural machine translation system in 2016. \n\nThe landscape changed dramatically in 2017 when Google introduced the transformer model, leveraging the attention mechanism as the core innovation for sequence modeling. Transformers outperformed prior architectures and underpinned pivotal models such as BERT (encoder-only, released in 2018) and the GPT series (decoder-only, starting in 2018). BERT rapidly became a standard in academia before the field shifted focus back to decoder-only models due to their effective use in task prompting and their ability to generalize. OpenAI’s GPT-2 (2019) and GPT-3 (2020) attracted attention for their scale and capabilities, while ChatGPT, based on GPT-3, popularized LLMs with the broader public. The release of GPT-4 and OpenAI o1 further advanced capabilities, including multimodal processing and robust reasoning. \n\nThe competitive landscape diversified with open initiatives such as BLOOM and LLaMA, and further innovations by Mistral AI and DeepSeek, providing increasingly permissively licensed and large-scale open models. Parallel to these developments, LLMs evolved into large multimodal models (LMMs), capable of handling not just text, but also images and audio. Transformer-based models remain dominant, though research continues into alternative architectures including advanced recurrent networks and novel models like Mamba.",
      "conclusion": "In summary, the field of large language models has undergone remarkable transformation since the 1990s, culminating in sophisticated architectures like transformers. Ongoing innovation, increasing openness, and multimodality trends continue to push LLMs into new domains and applications, driving research and societal impact."
