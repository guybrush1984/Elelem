      "introduction": "Before transformers reshaped natural‑language processing in 2017, language modeling progressed through several distinct eras. Early statistical models in the 1990s, notably IBM's word‑alignment work, laid the foundation for corpus‑based approaches. By 2001, smoothed n‑gram models trained on hundreds of millions of words achieved state‑of‑the‑art perplexities, while the 2000s saw the rise of massive web‑derived corpora. The turn of the millennium also introduced neural networks for language, culminating in word‑embedding breakthroughs such as Word2Vec (2013) and LSTM‑based sequence‑to‑sequence systems that powered the first neural machine translation services. This historical trajectory set the stage for the transformer revolution.",
      "development": "The transformer architecture, presented by Google researchers at NeurIPS 2017 in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need,\" replaced recurrent connections with self‑attention, enabling parallel processing of sequences and superior performance over the preceding 2014 seq2seq models. Its encoder‑decoder structure inspired a wave of transformer‑based models, starting with the encoder‑only BERT in 2018, which quickly became ubiquitous in research and industry. While BERT dominated the field for several years, the emergence of decoder‑only models such as OpenAI's GPT series shifted focus toward generative capabilities. GPT‑1 (2018) introduced the concept, but GPT‑2 (2019) garnered widespread attention due to concerns over misuse, prompting a cautious release strategy. GPT‑3 (2020) expanded scale dramatically, offering API‑only access, and the 2022 launch of ChatGPT popularized conversational AI among the public. GPT‑4 (2023) further improved accuracy and introduced multimodal reasoning, although its architecture and parameter count remained undisclosed. The release of ChatGPT spurred interdisciplinary research, influencing robotics, software engineering, and societal impact studies. In 2024, OpenAI unveiled the o1 reasoning model, which generates extensive chains of thought before delivering answers, showcasing advanced prompting techniques. Parallel to proprietary developments, open‑source initiatives gained momentum. Models like BLOOM, LLaMA, and Mistral's 7B and Mixtral 8x7B provided high‑performance alternatives under permissive licenses, while DeepSeek's R1 (2025) offered a 671‑billion‑parameter open‑weight model rivaling proprietary systems at lower cost. Since 2023, many large language models have been extended to multimodal capabilities, processing images, audio, and other data types, earning the designation of large multimodal models (LMMs). By 2024, transformers remained the dominant architecture for the largest and most capable models, though research also explored recurrent variants and state‑space models like Mamba as potential alternatives.",
      "conclusion": "Transformers have become the backbone of modern large language models, driving rapid advancements in scale, capability, and multimodal processing, while open‑source alternatives and novel architectures continue to diversify the field."
