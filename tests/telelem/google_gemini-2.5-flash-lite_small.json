In a large bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup granulated sugar, 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Ensure all dry ingredients are well combined.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1 large egg, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Make sure the egg is fully incorporated. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix the batter.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Carefully stir in 1/2 cup of boiling water into the batter. The batter will be thin, which is normal for this type of chocolate cake. This step helps to bloom the cocoa powder, intensifying the chocolate flavor and creating a moist crumb. Mix until smooth.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pan. Tap the pan gently on the counter a couple of times to release any large air bubbles. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 10-15 minutes. Then, carefully invert the cake onto the wire rack to cool completely. Ensure the cake is entirely cool before frosting to prevent melting.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once completely cooled, frost the chocolate cake with your favorite chocolate buttercream or ganache. This recipe yields one 9-inch round cake, perfect for serving 8 people. Decorate as desired and enjoy this delicious, moist chocolate treat with friends and family.\"\n}",
