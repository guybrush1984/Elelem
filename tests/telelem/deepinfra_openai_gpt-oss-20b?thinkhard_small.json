In a mixing bowl whisk together 1 \u00be cups all-purpose flour, \u00be cup cocoa powder, 2 cups granulated sugar, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking powder, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon salt.\",\"step2\":\"In a separate large bowl, beat \u00be cup (180 ml) butter at medium speed until creamy. Add 3 large eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and whisk until mixture is smooth and lightly frothy for texture, continue beating 2 minutes.\",\"step3\":\"Combine wet and dry mixtures gently. Pour flour mixture into the butter\u2011egg mixture, alternating with 1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk, starting and ending with flour. Stir until just combined; overmixing will make the cake dense. Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the surface. Seal the batter with small towel overflow.\",\"step4\":\"Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely before frosting. For aroma, the cake with chocolate syrup.\",\"step5\":\"Whisk together 1 cup (225 g) powdered sugar, \u00bd cup cocoa powder, \u00bc cup melted butter, 2 tablespoons heavy cream, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until fluffy. Spoon frosting over the cooled cake, spreading evenly with a spatula. Add a sprinkle of chocolate shavings for garnish. Dust with powdered sugar.\",\"step6\":\"To keep layers moist, slice a ciabatta loaf, spread chocolate buttercream inside, and cut into cake-sized squares. Or drizzle additional chocolate glaze over the frosted layers. Serve immediately with a dusting of cocoa powder or a splash of espresso for a rich finish that satisfies every chocolate lover at home.\"}",
