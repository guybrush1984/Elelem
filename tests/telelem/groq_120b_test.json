    "content": "{\n  \"step1\": \"Gather ingredients: 2\u00bd cups flour, 2 cups sugar, \u00be cup cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1\u00bd teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 cup milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1 cup boiling water. Ensure everything is at room temperature properly ready.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease and line two 9\u2011inch round cake pans with parchment. In a large bowl, whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together until uniformly combined, eliminating lumps for a smooth batter foundation that will rise evenly during baking creating a tender, moist texture.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Combine wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, beat milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla until light. Slowly pour the boiling water into this mixture, whisking continuously; the batter will appear thin, which is normal and ensures a moist crumb once baked for the eight\u2011person serving size, this yields generous slices today.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Gradually add dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring with a rubber spatula until just combined; over\u2011mixing can create toughness. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing tops with the spatula to ensure uniform layers that will bake evenly and rise to a dome, providing a surface for frosting.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Bake cakes for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges with only moist crumbs. Allow them to cool in pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto wire racks to cool completely, preventing soggy bottoms. This step is crucial for achieving a structure that holds frosting cracking.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Prepare frosting: melt \u00bd cup butter, stir in 2\u00be cups powdered sugar, \u00bd cup cocoa, \u00bc cup milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla until smooth. Spread frosting between layers and over the cake, then garnish with chocolate shavings or fresh berries for an elegant finish suitable for eight guests and enjoyment.\"\n}",
