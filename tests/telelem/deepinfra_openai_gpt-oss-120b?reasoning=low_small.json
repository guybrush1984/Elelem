Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F now.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large mixing bowl combine dry components: flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together until uniform, ensuring no lumps remain. This creates a consistent base for the batter, promoting even rise and smooth texture throughout the cake layers once baked.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Create the wet mixture by blending buttermilk, vegetable oil, eggs, vanilla, and hot water in a separate container. Beat vigorously for about one minute until emulsified and slightly frothy, which incorporates air and helps achieve a tender crumb in the final chocolate cake.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring gently with a spatula. Fold until just combined, avoiding overmixing which can develop gluten and produce a dense crumb. The batter will appear thin and glossy, a sign of proper incorporation.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Divide the batter evenly between two greased and floured 9\u2011inch round cake pans. Tap pans lightly on the counter to release air bubbles. Bake in the preheated oven for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near the center emerges clean.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Allow cakes to cool in pans for ten minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. Frost with chocolate ganache or buttercream as desired, then slice into eight generous portions, serving each with a smile and optional dusting of cocoa powder.\"\n}",
