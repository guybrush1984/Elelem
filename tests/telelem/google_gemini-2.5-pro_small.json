In a large bowl, gather your dry ingredients: 2 cups of sugar, 1 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Whisk all the dry ingredients together in the large bowl until they are thoroughly combined and free of lumps. This step is crucial for ensuring the leavening agents are evenly distributed, which will help your cake rise properly and have a consistent, tender crumb throughout the final baked product.\",\n  \"step3\": \"In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredients. Add 2 large eggs, 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Whisk these together until the mixture is smooth and uniform. This blend will add the necessary fat, moisture, and flavor.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed with an electric mixer until just combined. Do not overmix. Carefully add 1 cup of boiling water to the batter and stir until smooth. The batter will be very thin, which is perfectly normal.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Pour the thin batter evenly into your two prepared cake pans. Place them in the preheated oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. You can check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; if it comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, it's ready.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can stack and frost the layers with your favorite chocolate frosting. Slice into 8 pieces and enjoy your delicious cake!\"\n}",
