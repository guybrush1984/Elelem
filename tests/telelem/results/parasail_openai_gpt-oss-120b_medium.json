      "introduction": "Before the transformer era, language modeling progressed through a series of milestones shaped by computational limits and data availability. Early IBM statistical models in the 1990s introduced word alignment for machine translation, while a 2001 smoothed n‑gram model trained on 300 million words set new perplexity benchmarks. The 2000s saw the rise of web‑scale corpora, and researchers began exploring neural networks for language tasks, culminating in word embeddings and LSTM‑based sequence‑to‑sequence systems. This historical backdrop sets the stage for the transformative impact of attention mechanisms and the transformer architecture that would soon dominate the field.",
      "development": "The shift from n‑gram statistics to neural approaches began around 2000, leveraging deep learning breakthroughs in image classification to build word embeddings such as Word2Vec (2013) and LSTM‑based encoder‑decoder models for translation. Google’s 2016 adoption of neural machine translation replaced phrase‑based systems with recurrent networks, demonstrating the viability of deep architectures for linguistic tasks. The watershed moment arrived at NeurIPS 2017, when Google researchers unveiled the transformer in \"Attention Is All You Need,\" a model that eliminated recurrence in favor of multi‑head self‑attention, improving parallelism and performance. BERT (2018) extended the encoder‑only paradigm, quickly becoming ubiquitous in research, though its prominence waned by 2023 as decoder‑only models like GPT demonstrated superior zero‑shot prompting capabilities. GPT‑1 (2018) introduced the decoder‑only design; GPT‑2 (2019) attracted attention for its size and release controversy, while GPT‑3 (2020) cemented the API‑only model distribution model. The 2022 launch of ChatGPT popularized large language models (LLMs) among the public, leading to rapid adoption across subfields such as robotics and software engineering. GPT‑4 (2023) added multimodal processing, though its architecture and parameter count remained undisclosed, and OpenAI’s 2024 o1 model introduced reasoning chains. Concurrently, open‑weight models proliferated: BLOOM and LLaMA (2022), Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b with permissive licenses, and DeepSeek R1 (2025) offering 671 billion parameters at lower cost. Since 2023, many LLMs have been extended to multimodal capabilities, forming large multimodal models (LMMs). While transformers dominate the largest models as of 2024, alternative architectures such as recurrent variants and Mamba state‑space models are emerging, hinting at future diversification.",
      "conclusion": "From early statistical alignments to today’s massive multimodal transformers, language modeling has continually expanded in scale, capability, and accessibility, reshaping both research and everyday applications."
