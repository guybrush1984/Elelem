Grease two 8-inch round cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper. This ensures easy cake release.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Mix 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Whisk to combine dry ingredients.\",\n  \"step3\": \"In a large mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 1 cup whole milk. Add 2 large eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth and well combined.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Add dry ingredients to chocolate mixture and whisk until just combined. Do not overmix. Ensure a smooth batter for even cake texture.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Check for doneness.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, frost and decorate as desired with chocolate frosting and toppings.\"\n}\n```",
