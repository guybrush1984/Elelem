      "introduction": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has undergone significant transformations since the 1990s. Early models, such as IBM's statistical models and smoothed n-gram models, paved the way for corpus-based language modeling. The introduction of neural networks and deep learning architectures in the 2000s marked a substantial shift in the field. This evolution culminated in the development of transformer-based models, which have become the foundation for many recent LLMs.",
      "development": "The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 by Google researchers marked a significant milestone in the development of LLMs. The transformer architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms, enabled the creation of more efficient and effective models. BERT, an encoder-only model introduced in 2018, quickly became a widely-used LLM. Meanwhile, decoder-only models like GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3 gained attention for their capabilities and restrictions on public release. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 brought extensive media coverage and public attention to LLMs. Since then, many LLMs have been developed, including source-available models like BLOOM, LLaMA, and Mistral AI's models. The largest and most capable models, such as GPT-4 and OpenAI o1, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. Recent developments include the creation of multimodal models, which can process and generate multiple types of data, such as images and audio.",
      "conclusion": "The field of large language models has rapidly evolved in recent years, driven by advances in transformer-based architectures and the development of more efficient and effective models. The increasing availability of source-available models and the growing capabilities of LLMs are expected to have a significant impact on various applications and research areas in computer science."
