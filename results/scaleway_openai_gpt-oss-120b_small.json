      "step1": "Gather ingredients: 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 2 ½ cups granulated sugar, 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 cup strong coffee, ½ cup vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1 cup hot water. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).",
      "step2": "In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk in sugar until evenly distributed. In a separate bowl, combine buttermilk, coffee, oil, eggs, and vanilla; beat until smooth and slightly frothy.",
      "step3": "Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring with a rubber spatula until just combined; avoid overmixing. The batter will be thick, then gently stir in the hot water, which will thin the batter and create a glossy texture, essential for a moist crumb.",
      "step4": "Prepare two 9‑inch round cake pans by greasing with butter and dusting with flour, or line with parchment circles. Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Tap pans lightly on the counter to release trapped air bubbles.",
      "step5": "Bake in the preheated oven for 30‑35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Rotate pans halfway through baking for even browning. Once done, remove from oven, place on a wire rack, and let cool 10 minutes before unlocking from pans.",
      "step6": "While cakes cool, prepare frosting: whisk ½ cup softened butter, ¾ cup cocoa powder, 3 cups powdered sugar, ¼ cup heavy cream, and 1 teaspoon vanilla until fluffy. Stack layers, spreading frosting between and over the top and sides. Garnish with chocolate shavings, then slice and serve eight generous pieces."
