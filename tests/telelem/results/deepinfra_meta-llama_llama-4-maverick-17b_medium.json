      "introduction": "The evolution of large language models (LLMs) began long before the transformer-based models emerged in 2017. Early models used statistical techniques and neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art results. The introduction of transformer architecture marked a significant shift in the development of LLMs.",
      "development": "Initially, statistical models like n-gram models with Kneser-Ney smoothing achieved state-of-the-art perplexity on benchmark tests. The rise of the internet enabled the compilation of massive text datasets, and researchers began using neural networks to learn language models. The development of word embeddings and sequence-to-sequence models using LSTM marked a significant improvement. The introduction of transformer architecture in 2017 revolutionized the field, and models like BERT and GPT became ubiquitous. Decoder-only models like GPT gained popularity, and multimodal models that can process or generate other types of data emerged.",
      "conclusion": "As of 2024, the largest and most capable models are based on the transformer architecture, with a trend towards multimodal capabilities and open-weight models."
