Gather all ingredients; ensure butter and eggs are at room temperature for optimal mixing and cake texture. This preparation is key.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: 1 \u00be cups all-purpose flour, 1 \u00be cups granulated sugar, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking soda, 1 \u00bd teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt. Ensure no lumps remain.\",\n  \"step3\": \"In a separate medium bowl, combine the wet ingredients. Whisk 2 large eggs, 1 cup milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract until well blended. A splash of coffee can enhance chocolate flavor, adding depth and richness to your cake.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Gradually add the wet ingredient mixture to the dry ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix. Stir in 1 cup hot water or hot brewed coffee until the batter is smooth and pourable, creating a luscious base for your cake.\",\n  \"step5\": \"Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Avoid opening the oven door too early, as this can cause the cake to sink and affect its texture.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Let cakes cool in pans on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes before inverting onto the rack to cool completely. Once fully cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate ganache or buttercream. Serve 8 delicious slices of rich, moist chocolate cake to your guests!\"\n}\n```",
