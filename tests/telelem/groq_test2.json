In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 1\u00be cups all\u2011purpose flour, \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 cups granulated sugar, 1\u00bd teaspoons baking powder, 1\u00bd teaspoons baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate bowl, combine 2 large eggs, 1 cup whole milk, \u00bd cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and slightly frothy. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture, whisking gently until just combined; the batter will be thick but pourable.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Add 1 cup boiling water to the batter, stirring slowly to avoid lumps. The batter will become thin; this is normal. Fold in \u00bd cup chocolate chips or chunks for extra texture, if desired. Ensure no large clumps remain before transferring to the prepared pan.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the batter into the greased pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Place in the oven and bake for 30\u201135 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few crumbs. Avoid over\u2011baking to keep the cake moist.\",\n  \"step5\": \"While the cake cools, prepare a simple chocolate glaze: melt \u00bd cup butter and 1 cup powdered sugar in a saucepan over low heat, stirring until smooth. Stir in 4 tablespoons heavy cream and \u00bd cup cocoa powder until the glaze thickens to a spreadable consistency.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Once completely cooled, drizzle the chocolate glaze over the top, allowing it to set. Slice into 8 equal portions, serve, and enjoy your rich, moist chocolate cake.\"\n}\n```",
