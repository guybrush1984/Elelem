      "step1": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour three 9‑inch round cake pans, then set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together 3 cups all‑purpose flour, 2 ½ cups granulated sugar, 1 ½ cups unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt until evenly combined.",
      "step2": "In a separate mixer, combine 1 cup vegetable oil, 1 cup buttermilk, 4 large eggs, and 2 tsp vanilla extract; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Slowly add 1 cup hot water to the wet mixture, stirring gently to incorporate without splattering, creating a glossy batter.",
      "step3": "Gradually pour the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, folding with a spatula until just combined—avoid over‑mixing to keep the crumb tender. The batter should be smooth, slightly thin, and glossy. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula.",
      "step4": "Bake for 30‑35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean with a few moist crumbs. Rotate the pans halfway through baking for even rise. Remove from oven, place on wire racks, and let cool for 10 minutes in pans.",
      "step5": "After the initial cooling, run a thin knife around each cake’s edge, invert onto the racks, and peel off the parchment. Let the layers cool completely, about 20‑30 minutes, before frosting. Prepare a chocolate buttercream by beating 1 cup softened butter, 3 cups powdered sugar, ½ cup cocoa, and 2 tbsp milk until fluffy.",
      "step6": "Assemble the cake by placing the first layer on a serving plate, spreading a generous amount of frosting, then repeat with the second and third layers. Frost the top and sides smoothly, creating swirls or a simple finish. Garnish with chocolate shavings, slice, and serve eight delighted guests."
