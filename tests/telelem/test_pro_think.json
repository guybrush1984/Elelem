In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1.5 cups of granulated sugar, \u00be cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1.5 teaspoons of baking soda, 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.\",\n  \"step2\": \"In a separate medium bowl, combine 2 large eggs, 1 cup of milk, \u00bd cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Whisk these wet ingredients together until they are smooth and fully incorporated. This mixture will provide the cake with its moisture and richness.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredient bowl. Mix on low speed until just combined. Carefully add 1 cup of boiling water to the batter and mix until smooth. The batter will be thin; this is normal. The hot water helps to bloom the cocoa for a deeper flavor.\",\n  \"step4\": \"Pour the batter evenly into the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\",\n  \"step5\": \"To make a simple chocolate frosting, beat \u00bd cup of softened butter until creamy. Gradually beat in 2 cups of powdered sugar and \u00bd cup of cocoa powder, alternating with 3-4 tablespoons of milk until the frosting is smooth and spreadable. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.\",\n  \"step6\": \"Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on your serving plate. Spread a generous amount of frosting on top. Place the second layer over it, and then frost the top and sides of the entire cake. Slice and serve your delicious homemade chocolate cake to your guests.\"\n}\n```",
