Gather 1\u00be cups flour, \u00be cup cocoa, 2 cups sugar, 1\u00bd tsp baking powder, 1\u00bd tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt. Sift together into large bowl.\",\n  \"step2\": \"Add 2 eggs, 1 cup whole milk, \u00bd cup oil, 2 tsp vanilla to dry mix. Beat on medium 30 seconds until combined. Carefully pour in 1 cup hot coffee; batter will be thin. Beat 1 minute more, scraping bowl, until glossy and smooth.\",\n  \"step3\": \"Divide batter evenly between pans; tap to release bubbles. Bake 30\u201332 minutes, until centers spring back and toothpick comes out with moist crumbs. Cool in pans 10 minutes, then invert onto racks, peel parchment, and cool completely, about 1 hour.\",\n  \"step4\": \"For ganache, heat 1 cup cream to simmer; pour over 8 oz chopped dark chocolate. Let stand 2 minutes, whisk until silky. Chill 30 minutes, stirring, until spreadable.

Chill 20 minutes to set. Slice into 8 wedges with hot knife. Serve at room temperature for fudgiest texture; leftovers keep 3 days covered at cool room temperature.\"\n}",
